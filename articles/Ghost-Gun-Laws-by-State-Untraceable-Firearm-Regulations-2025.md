# Ghost Gun Laws by State: Understanding the Current Regulatory Landscape

In the wake of increasingly sophisticated firearm technology, the legal definition of a "firearm" has become a pivotal issue in gun control debates. The 2022 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) ruling reclassified firearm components kits as firearms themselves, subjecting them to stringent federal regulations. This legal evolution marks a significant shift in how untraceable firearms are regulated, with implications for both individual assembly processes and commercial manufacture. Understanding the current landscape of ghost gun laws requires examining the federal regulations that have taken shape since this pivotal ruling, as well as the varied state-level responses to this novel challenge in firearm oversight.


## The Evolution of Ghost Gun Laws

The Biden-Harris administration's response to the proliferation of untraceable firearms took a significant legal and regulatory turn in 2022. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued a rule that redefined key elements of ghost gun regulation under the 1968 Gun Control Act. Central to this reinterpretation was the classification of firearm components kits as firearms themselves, requiring serial numbering, background checks, and dealer licensing—regulations previously applied only to fully assembled firearms.

The Supreme Court's subsequent ruling in Bondi v. VanDerStok upheld this interpretation, rejecting arguments that a collection of parts could not constitute a firearm. Writing for the majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch emphasized the 1968 law's broad language, which defines a firearm as "any weapon that is designed to, or may readily be converted to, expel a projectile by the action of a combustible material." This legal precedent set the stage for enhanced oversight of the unregulated firearm parts market, where kits could be purchased and assembled into functional weapons in as little as 15 minutes.

The legal evolution on ghost guns reflects broader shifts in how lawmakers and regulatory bodies address novel firearms technologies. While the regulation's primary focus was on commercial manufacturers and dealers, its impact extends to individual assembly processes. The rule's effect on the market's expansion is notable, with recoveries of privately-made untraceable firearms increasing dramatically—by 1,300% from 2016 to 2022. This rapid proliferation underscores the challenge of regulating emerging firearm technologies while maintaining public safety.


## Federal Regulations on Ghost Guns

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' 2022 rule redefined critical elements of ghost gun regulation under the 1968 Gun Control Act, classifying firearm components kits as firearms themselves. This means that all ghost gun kits and unfinished frames/receivers must be serialized, sold through licensed dealers, and subject to Brady Background Checks.

A key aspect of the regulation is its treatment of "firearm control components" - essential parts that enable functional operation, including hammers, bolts, triggers, and firing pins. These components are now subject to the same federal laws and regulations as other commercially manufactured firearms, requiring serial numbers and dealer licensing at the point of first commercial sale.

The regulation's impact extends to both manufacturers and sellers of ghost gun parts and kits. All entities must now comply with federal firearm regulations, addressing the industry's previous claim that these parts were not considered firearms. Between 2016 and 2022, the number of privately-made untraceable firearms recovered by law enforcement increased dramatically, rising 1,300%. This growth has been fueled by the ease of manufacture - an unqualified individual can assemble a functional ghost gun in under an hour using basic tools.

The regulation's effectiveness in reducing untraceable firearms has been demonstrated through multiple studies. A January 2025 national survey found broad support among American voters, with 67% of Trump voters, 69% of Republicans, 86% of Democrats, 66% of Independents, and 69% of gun owners supporting the regulation. Data from the Baltimore Police Department shows that ghost guns are primarily recovered from individuals prohibited from lawful firearm possession, including minors and felons. The California Department of Justice reports significant reductions in privately-made untraceable firearms through 2023.


## State-by-State Overview

The regulation's impact varies significantly across states. Thirteen states have banned both sales and manufacturing of ghost guns entirely: California, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. Each of these states requires reporting of all ghost guns to officials and enforces stringent background check requirements for firearm components. Connecticut, Hawaii, and Nevada have implemented additional restrictions on manufacturing and ownership. Several localities and cities have enacted their own regulations, including Montgomery County, MD; San Francisco; Philadelphia; and San Diego.

Thirty-five states have adopted some form of regulatory measure. California requires serial numbers and background checks for component parts and mandates reporting of all ghost guns to officials. Colorado requires serial numbers for parts used to make ghost guns. Connecticut similarly requires serial numbers and background checks for component parts, mandating reporting of all ghost guns to officials and banning plastic undetectable guns. Hawaii requires serial numbers for parts used to make ghost guns. Massachusetts requires serial numbers and background checks for all firearms and component parts, mandating reporting of all ghost guns to officials.

Several states have taken specific actions regarding 3D-printed firearms. Washington state, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Oregon, Delaware, and Hawaii have all enacted restrictions on 3D printing technology related to firearm components. These regulations demonstrate a nationwide response to the growing threat of unregulated firearm kits, with legal experts emphasizing the importance of maintaining traceability and background check requirements for these dangerous weapons.


## Public Health Perspective

Public health experts emphasize that regulation of ghost guns is crucial, particularly regarding their impact on youth access to firearms and public safety. They highlight that these unserialized, untraceable weapons have been involved in numerous violent incidents across the country, from homicides to school shootings.

Research indicates that ghost guns have seen unprecedented growth in both sales and criminal use. Between 2016 and 2021, sales increased by 1,000%, with law enforcement recovering over 19,000 in 2021 alone—almost two-thirds of which were involved in homicide investigations. Notable jumps in recoveries include 2,775% in Baltimore and 11,433% in Washington, D.C., between 2017 and 2021.

The ease of manufacture makes these weapons particularly concerning. A hand drill or basic drill press is all that's needed for assembly, with a complete firearm being constructible in under an hour—similar to assembling furniture. A 2025 national survey by the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions found widespread support for regulating do-it-yourself gun kits, with 67% of Trump voters, 69% of Republicans, 86% of Democrats, 66% of Independents, and 69% of gun owners backing the restrictions.

Legal experts frame the issue through public health principles, noting that ghost guns create "a dangerous loophole that undermines current gun regulations, poses significant public safety risks, and hinders law enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and solve crimes." Professor Jonathan Jay from Boston University School of Public Health emphasizes that "restrictions on ghost guns really important," while highlighting that "more guns means more risk" from these unregulated weapons.


## Future of Ghost Gun Regulation

The Supreme Court's decision in Bondi v. VanDerStok has set a pivotal legal foundation for federal ghost gun regulation. The 7-2 ruling upheld the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF) 2022 rule, which expanded the legal definition of firearms to include core building blocks of ghost guns. This classification requires these parts to be serialized, sold through licensed dealers, and subject to Brady Background Checks—a significant expansion of federal oversight initially challenged by gun manufacturers and rights groups.

At the state level, legislative action continues to address the proliferation of untraceable firearms. Since the federal regulation took effect, 36 states have enacted some form of ghost gun regulation, including comprehensive bans in California, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. This legislative activity demonstrates a bipartisan commitment to closing regulatory loopholes, with federal law enforcement reporting dramatic reductions in privately-made untraceable firearms—recoveries increased from 2,000 in 2016 to over 19,000 in 2021.

The legal status of ghost guns remains a focal point for both public health advocates and firearm rights proponents. While the Supreme Court's ruling reaffirmed federal regulatory authority, the ongoing legal challenges underscore the continued need for clear legislative guidance. With a 6-3 conservative majority, the Court's decision represents a critical moment in establishing regulatory precedent, though the long-term framework for ghost gun regulation will likely depend on future legislative action and judicial interpretation. As the legal landscape continues to evolve, public safety advocates continue to push for comprehensive oversight that maintains firearm traceability while respecting constitutional rights.
