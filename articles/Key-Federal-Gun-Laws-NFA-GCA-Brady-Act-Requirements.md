# Key Federal Gun Laws: National Firearms Act & Gun Control Act

The regulation of firearms in the United States has its roots in the 1930s, with landmark legislation like the National Firearms Act of 1934 laying the groundwork for federal gun control measures. These laws have evolved significantly over the decades, responding to changing social, political, and criminal contexts. From the Gun Control Act of 1968 to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, each piece of legislation has addressed specific aspects of firearm regulation, from interstate commerce controls to background checks and prohibited possessor lists. The legal landscape continues to develop through amendments and court decisions, particularly regarding the balance between regulation and individual rights protected by the Second Amendment. As the debate over gun control remains contentious, understanding the federal framework of firearm regulation is crucial for both legal practitioners and the general public.


## The National Firearms Act of 1934

The National Firearms Act of 1934 marked the beginning of federal regulation of firearms in the United States. Enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code, the NFA established groundbreaking requirements for specific weapon categories, imposing taxes and registration mandates that would set a precedent for future firearm legislation.

The Act targeted weapons closely associated with organized crime during its time, including short-barreled shotguns and rifles, machine guns, firearm mufflers and silencers, and certain "any other weapons" capable of concealment. These restrictions applied to weapons with barrels less than 18 inches in length, overall weapons under 26 inches, and modifications that increased barrel length below these thresholds.

To enforce these regulations, the NFA required manufacturers and transferees to obtain special (occupational) taxes for each place of business and pay annual tax fees for NFA firearms made or transferred. The Act's $200 tax on most NFA firearms remained unchanged since its initial implementation, demonstrating the legislative body's intention to create a significant financial barrier to prohibited transactions.

The NFA's provisions were designed to address specific crime problems, particularly gang-related activities. The law's underlying purpose was to curtail the transfer and possession of these weapons, with the $200 making and transfer taxes serving as a deterrent to unauthorized transactions. This approach represented the first major federal effort to regulate firearms through taxation and registration, establishing a foundation for subsequent gun control legislation.


## The Gun Control Act of 1968

The Gun Control Act of 1968 established the first comprehensive federal framework for investigating and prosecuting firearms crimes. Its primary goals are to prevent firearm possession by prohibited persons and assist law enforcement in combating crime.

At the core of the GCA is a licensing scheme for interstate movement of firearms. Federal firearms licensees (FFLs) must obtain a license from the Secretary of the Treasury to ship, transport, and receive firearms in interstate or foreign commerce. These licensees must maintain records of all acquisitions and dispositions of firearms and comply with state and local laws in transferring firearms. This recordkeeping helps trace crime guns.

The Act prohibits certain persons from receiving firearms, including convicted felons, fugitives, drug addicts, persons committed to mental institutions, dishonorably discharged military personnel, renounced citizens, illegal aliens, persons subject to domestic violence restraining orders, and those convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence. It also restricts handgun possession to individuals 18-21 years old and long gun transfers to individuals 18-26 years old.

The GCA established severe penalties for violations, including five-year prison terms for firearm use in crimes of violence or drug trafficking. Sentences increased to fifteen years for felons with three prior violent felony or serious drug offense convictions. Short-barreled rifles, shotguns, or semiautomatic assault weapons carry a ten-year sentence enhancement, while machine guns, destructive devices, or silenced firearms trigger a thirty-year enhancement. Repeat GCA violations are punishable by up to twenty years in prison or life imprisonment.

In response to the 1980s crack epidemic, Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act and the Armed Career Criminal Act, which significantly toughened penalties. The Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, while protecting some rights of law-abiding citizens, inadvertently created loopholes for illegal gun traffickers. This legislation eliminated requirements for dealers to maintain records of firearm sales, prohibited the federal government from maintaining a central database of dealer records, and allowed FFLs to conduct business at gun shows.

The GCA's regulations have evolved through several amendments, with notable changes occurring in 1986 and 1993. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act expanded background check requirements, replacing the original five-day waiting period with an instant check system that can be extended to three days when results are not clear. The Act now applies to all types of firearms, not just handguns, following amendments in 1998.

These provisions demonstrate the GCA's broad impact on firearm regulation, establishing detailed standards for legal firearm possession and establishing the legal framework for future gun control measures.


## Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act

The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act significantly expanded federal firearm regulation by requiring background checks for firearm purchases. Passed in 1993, it amended the Gun Control Act of 1968 to implement a system ofinstant background checks, initially establishing a five-day waiting period that could be extended to three days when verification was unclear.

The legislation created a legal framework for state and local authorities to conduct background checks through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Federal firearms licensees and dealers are required to verify the eligibility of potential purchasers through this system before completing transactions, with exceptions for individuals with comprehensive state-issued firearms permits.

The Brady Act introduced several key provisions:

- Exempted individuals with federal firearms licenses or state-issued permits from the waiting period requirement

- Established comprehensive standards for background check implementation, including training requirements for law enforcement personnel

- Mandated annual reports to Congress on the status of background check implementation and results

These changes represented a significant advancement in federal gun control measures, creating a more robust legal framework for investigating firearm purchases while maintaining protections for law-abiding citizens. The legislation's impact continues to shape federal firearm regulations through subsequent amendments that expanded its scope and enhanced implementation capabilities.


## Federal vs. State Gun Laws

Federal firearms regulation involves shared authority among federal, state, and local governments. While the federal framework established by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 serves as a floor for permissible firearm use and transactions, states have broad latitude to supplement federal law with additional restrictions.

The federal government's authority stems primarily from its tax, commerce, and spending powers. The Commerce Clause initially lacked provisions directly regulating commercial activities or requiring possession to be connected to interstate commerce. Congress subsequently amended the provision to require that firearm possession in school zones be shown to "move in or ... otherwise affect interstate or foreign commerce." This amended version has been upheld by lower courts against constitutional challenges.

The Spending Power grants Congress broad authority to enact legislation for the "general welfare" through conditions on federal funds distributed to states. Conditions must be written unambiguously, be germane to the federal program, not induce unconstitutional activity, and not be so coercive as to pass the point of compulsion. The Supreme Court has established four key limitations: clarity, relevance, constitutional compliance, and non-coercion.

Notably, in South Dakota v. Dole (1984), the Court upheld a 5% withholding of highway funds from states with lower minimum drinking ages, describing it as "relatively mild encouragement." However, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (NFIB) (2012), the Court struck down a Medicaid expansion provision, finding it analogous to "a gun to the head" and thus unlawfully coercive.

The Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms, as explicitly established by District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). This protection applies to state and local laws through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (2022), the Court struck down New York's may-issue policy requiring proper cause for concealed carry licenses, while allowing states to enforce shall-issue permitting with objective criteria such as background checks.

Gun regulation at the federal level has evolved significantly since the 1930s and 60s, with legislation addressing diverse issues including 3D-printed firearms, background checks, concealed carry reciprocity, mental health concerns, specific firearm and accessory restrictions, and red flag laws. The constitutional framework continues to evolve through Supreme Court decisions, with ongoing debate about the appropriate balance between regulation and individual rights.


## Penalties and Legal Consequences

Penalties for gun violations can range from substantial monetary fines to long-term imprisonment, with particularly severe consequences for firearm trafficking. Under federal law, violations can result in fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to ten years for knowing or willful violations. For unlawful possession of firearms under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), the government must prove only that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm, not necessarily that he had knowledge of his status as a felon at the time of possession.

The legal framework for defending against gun violations includes several key strategies. Lack of knowledge can be demonstrated in cases where individuals are unaware of illegal firearm possession, while mistaken identity claims provide evidence that another person committed the crime. Entrapment defenses may be applicable when law enforcement induced the defendant to commit the offense. Additionally, constitutional rights arguments can challenge prosecution based on Fourth Amendment violations, such as unlawful searches and seizures.
