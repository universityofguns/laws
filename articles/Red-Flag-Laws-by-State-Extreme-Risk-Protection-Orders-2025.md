# Red Flag Laws by State: Understanding Extreme Risk Protection Orders

In the wake of tragic mass shootings, lawmakers across America are grappling with how to prevent dangerous individuals from accessing firearms. The answer, in many cases, has been red flag laws - controversial yet increasingly common measures that allow authorities to temporarily seize weapons from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others. These extreme risk protection orders represent a significant shift in gun control policy, enabling proactive measures that didn't exist just a decade ago. From Connecticut's 1999 groundbreaking law to the recent federal funding initiative, red flag laws now govern how we navigate this complex intersection of personal rights and public safety.


## Origins and Development

The first red flag law was enacted in Connecticut in 1999 following a shooting at the Connecticut Lottery, marking the beginning of what would become a nationwide movement. This pioneering legislation allowed family members, law enforcement, and healthcare workers to file extreme risk protection orders when someone posed a serious threat to themselves or others with a firearm.

In the subsequent years, red flag laws gained momentum in response to tragic events. Indiana followed Connecticut's lead with the Jake Laird Law in 2005, named after an Indianapolis police officer killed by a mentally disturbed individual. California enacted its law in 2014, expanding initial petitioners to include family members, prosecutors, police officials, teachers, and school administrators.

The legislation took significant strides forward following the 2018 Parkland shooting in Florida. In the months that followed, 19 additional states and the District of Columbia implemented red flag laws, expanding access to protective orders through various means. Some states, like Massachusetts and Illinois, created specific gun violence restraining orders. Others, such as New Mexico, adopted risk protection orders, while Florida and Oregon developed distinct frameworks under titles like Gun Violence Restraining Orders and Extreme Risk Firearm Protection Orders.

Recent amendments have sought to enhance the effectiveness of these laws while maintaining constitutional protections. In Connecticut, reforms in 2021 and 2023 respectively expanded eligibility for petitions and streamlined the judicial process. These developments reflect ongoing efforts to balance public safety needs with Second Amendment rights.


## Legal Framework and Implementation

The legal framework governing red flag laws varies significantly by state, but common elements include the ability of family members, law enforcement, and sometimes healthcare providers to petition civil courts for the temporary seizure of firearms when an individual poses a danger to themselves or others. The process generally requires law enforcement to seize firearms based on evidence of threatening behavior.

Upon receipt of a petition, courts typically schedule expedited hearings to determine the validity of the claim. Some states allow for immediate protective orders when there's compelling evidence of imminent danger, while others provide a longer-term solution with regular review hearings. For example, Kansas's HB 2129 requires court action within 14 days, while Connecticut's law has proven particularly effective, with only 1% of orders being overturned on appeal.

The court's decision hinges on established criteria that can include threatening behavior, recent acts of violence, substance abuse, or documented psychiatric history. Law enforcement plays a crucial role in both initiating and enforcing these orders, with varying requirements across states. In some jurisdictions, officers can file petitions independently, while in others, they must work through formal court processes.

The legal landscape continues to evolve, with states implementing different approaches. While Connecticut's 1999 law established the basic framework, subsequent developments have focused on balancing effectiveness and due process. Courts have generally upheld these laws against constitutional challenges, particularly in cases involving civil rights violations. The Supreme Court's Bruen decision in 2024 confirmed that domestic violence restraining orders do not violate the Second Amendment, though it did invalidate New York's red flag law in a later ruling.


## Efficacy and Controversies

The implementation and effectiveness of red flag laws vary significantly across states. Adoption levels range from enthusiastic support in progressive states like California and New York to outright opposition in conservative jurisdictions. As of 2025, 19 states plus the District of Columbia have enacted such legislation, with New Hampshire's Democratic legislature successfully passing but Governor Chris Sununu's veto of similar legislation highlighting the political divide.

Petition volume has seen substantial growth, particularly after the 2018 Parkland shooting, with states experiencing 59% increases in filings between 2019 and 2023. However, implementation rates vary dramatically; New York's system, which allows multiple petitioners including employers and coworkers, filed 166 petitions in its first 22 months, while similarly structured laws in Colorado and Ohio saw much lower usage. This variance influences effectiveness, with states like Vermont and Washington experiencing 73% success rates in obtaining protective orders, compared to New Mexico's initial 23 filings over two years before policy adjustments.

The laws' efficacy extends beyond firearm confiscation to suicide prevention, with recent studies estimating one prevented suicide per 17 to 23 petitions. Training programs have proven crucial in successful implementation, particularly in jurisdictions where local law enforcement initially opposed the legislation. For example, after Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham established a task force in 2022, New Mexico saw petition numbers increase from 47 in 2023 to 96 in 2024, with Bernalillo County accounting for more than half of all filings.

While the laws enjoy broad public support - with 77% of Americans backing family-initiated orders and 70% supporting law enforcement-initiated ones - opposition persists from gun rights advocates and some local governments. The legal landscape remains dynamic, with ongoing efforts at both state and federal levels to expand or restrict these measures. Republican-led Oklahoma became the first state to enact an anti-red flag law in 2020, while other jurisdictions continue to evaluate their implementation strategies based on evolving data and legal precedents.


## State-Specific Legislation

California's red flag law, enacted in 2014, allows family members, prosecutors, police officials, teachers, and school administrators to petition for a one-year firearms restriction. This expansive legal framework demonstrates the state's commitment to implementing rigorous standards while maintaining due process protections.

In New York, the law experienced significant changes following initial challenges. The state's approach currently enables family members, prosecutors, and certain peace officers to seek protection orders. Notably, Governor Andrew Cuomo's 2019 signing of the nation's toughest red flag law established one of the most comprehensive legal frameworks. The law expands access to protective orders through multiple petitioners and stringent evidentiary requirements, including substantial restrictions on firearm access for individuals deemed a danger.

Florida adopted an innovative approach through its Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVAO) system in 2017. This legislation empowers law enforcement to file petitions independently, demonstrating a proactive stance in firearms prevention. The system has experienced notable success, filing 5,800 orders in just three years before targeted legislative restrictions.

Texas represents a different model through its legislative development process. While the state has not yet enacted a comprehensive red flag law, the Legislature's ongoing consideration reflects the evolving legal landscape. Texas's approach illustrates the potential for future state-level developments in firearms prevention legislation.

States like Massachusetts and Illinois have established significant legal precedents through their specific legislative frameworks. Massachusetts's law allows firearm prohibition orders for individuals found to be a danger to themselves, while Illinois's approach created comprehensive firearms restraining orders. These models offer valuable insights into the legal and practical considerations of implementing red flag laws.

The implementation landscape continues to evolve, with states like New Hampshire experiencing political challenges while others like Rhode Island and Vermont demonstrate successful legislative outcomes. Key variations include the petitioning body's scope, legal procedural requirements, and firearm restriction durations. These distinctions highlight the importance of tailored legislative approaches in balancing public safety and constitutional rights.


## Federal Developments and Funding

The federal landscape surrounding red flag laws has seen significant developments since Connecticut enacted the pioneering legislation in 1999. As of 2025, 19 states plus the District of Columbia have implemented such laws, with New Hampshire's Democratic legislature passing the legislation before Governor Chris Sununu's veto.

In response to growing public support for these measures, Congress took action through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022. This legislation established a federal grant program to support state implementation of red flag laws, marking a significant new resource for jurisdictions seeking to adopt this legislative framework. The grant program reflects growing bipartisan interest in addressing gun violence through comprehensive legislative approaches.

The landscape remains dynamic, with continued legal challenges and evolving political contexts. Following the Supreme Court's 2024 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, some existing state laws face constitutional scrutiny. This decision invalidated New York's red flag law specifically, highlighting ongoing legal complexities.

Despite these challenges, broad public support continues to drive legislative efforts at both state and federal levels. Presidential administrations have shown increasing support, with Vice President Harris calling for states to pass red flag laws and utilize federal funding resources. The Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, partnering with advocacy organizations, has implemented educational campaigns such as the "One Thing You Can Do" initiative to raise awareness about these protective measures.

This federal-funding opportunity represents a crucial resource for jurisdictions considering or implementing red flag laws. States like California, Illinois, and Massachusetts have successfully leveraged these funds to enhance local legislation and implementation strategies. The evolving federal landscape illustrates how these protective measures continue to influence broader gun control policy discussions while providing practical support for their implementation.
