# Bulk Gun Purchase Laws and Multiple Firearm Sales Restrictions

As state legislatures continue to grapple with the complex issue of firearm trafficking, one clear trend emerges: the effectiveness of limiting multiple firearm purchases. Studies consistently show that guns acquired through multiple transactions are far more likely to end up in criminal hands, making this approach one of the most robust methods for disrupting illegal firearm transfers. While the legal landscape remains in flux, with key challenges coming from gun rights organizations, the evidence overwhelmingly supports these restrictions as a critical tool for law enforcement and public safety. This article examines the implementation, effectiveness, and current legal status of bulk purchase laws across several states, highlighting both the progress made and the ongoing challenges in this evolving legal landscape.


## Overview of Bulk Gun Purchase Laws

As of 2024, California has implemented one of the most restrictive bulk purchase laws, prohibiting sales of all firearms (completed and unfinished frames/receivers) to buyers notified by the California Department of Justice of another handgun/semiautomatic centerfire rifle application within 30 days. This regulation applies to both dealer sales and private party transfers.

The state's approach aligns with best practices identified through research. Studies show that handguns sold in multiple transactions (two or more firearms to the same purchaser within 5 business days) are up to 64% more likely to be used in crimes compared to individual purchases. These short-time-to-crime guns are also twice as likely to have had their serial numbers removed, a common indicator of trafficking.

State agencies maintain purchase records to verify compliance with these limits. Federal law, under the Gun Control Act of 1968, requires federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to report multiple handgun purchases to the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives within five consecutive business days. For border states (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas), FFLs must report multiple sales of specific semiautomatic rifles capable of accepting detachable magazines and greater than .22 caliber.

While FFLs are subject to federal reporting requirements, the regulations fall short in several critical areas. Traffickers can easily evade these federal requirements by purchasing two or more guns over five business days from multiple dealers. Recognizing this limitation, California has implemented additional state-level measures requiring firearm sales to be reported to state or local law enforcement.

The effectiveness of these laws extends beyond individual states. Research from Virginia demonstrates that monthly purchase limits significantly disrupt illegal interstate firearm transfers. Between 2012 and 2014, Virginia's one-handgun-per-month law reduced seized trafficking firearms by 50% in the northern corridor while maintaining public safety for lawful citizens seeking to sell firearms.

The legal landscape around these regulations remains evolving. Gun Owners of California, Inc. has challenged their constitutionality, citing precedent set by NYSRPA v. Bruen and concerns about historical precedent when comparing modern purchase restrictions to founding-era laws. Despite these challenges, research continues to support the efficacy of bulk purchase restrictions in preventing firearm trafficking and criminal activity.


## State Implementation of Purchase Restrictions

As of now, five states - California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia - have enacted laws limiting firearm purchases and sales. These restrictions vary in both scope and implementation, with California setting one of the most comprehensive precedents.


### Implementation Details

California's approach, effective since January 1, 2024, prohibits firearm purchases from any notified California Department of Justice applicant for a handgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle within 30 days. This regulation applies to both dealer sales and private party transfers, making it one of the most restrictive in the nation.


### State-Specific Restrictions

Connecticut has implemented a three-handgun-per-month limit since 2023. Maryland prohibits more than one handgun or assault weapon purchase within 30 days, though exceptions exist for collectors, law enforcement, and specific circumstances approved by the Secretary of Maryland State Police. New Jersey restricts licensed dealers from delivering more than one handgun to any person within 30 days, with limited exceptions including law enforcement needs, concealed carry permit holders, and certain estate transactions.


### Border State Regulations

For border states including Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, federal regulations require FFLs to report multiple sales of specific semiautomatic rifles capable of accepting detachable magazines and exceeding .22 caliber. These border state requirements represent an additional layer of monitoring beyond the federal mandate.


### Reporting Requirements

Federal law mandates that FFLs report multiple handgun purchases to the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives within five consecutive business days. This system, however, has significant limitations, particularly in border regions where traffickers can circumvent reporting requirements by spreading purchases across multiple dealers.


### Additional Local Restrictions

New York City maintains particularly stringent local regulations, limiting handgun purchases to one per month while also applying a 90-day cap on purchases of handguns and rifles or shotguns. This comprehensive approach serves to significantly disrupt patterns of bulk firearm purchases that are more likely to facilitate criminal activity.


## Verification and Reporting Mechanisms

State agencies maintain centralized purchase records to verify compliance with established limits. For federal firearms licensees (FFLs), this system relies on ATF Form 3310.4 for reporting multiple handgun purchases. The form requires FFLs to submit reports when a single buyer acquires two or more handguns within a five-business-day period. This reporting mechanism enables local law enforcement to track patterns that may indicate illegal trafficking or other public safety risks.

Federal law extends reporting requirements to include private party transactions, particularly in border states. For rifles with specific characteristics - including semi-automatic capability and detachable magazines larger than .22 caliber - federal regulations mandate reporting when acquired through FFLs licensed as 01Dealer or 02Pawnbroker in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas. The reporting period follows actual business days, including weekends.

Dealer compliance with these reporting requirements is critical for law enforcement. When reporting multiple sales, dealers must fax or email submission to ATF by the end of the business day, while maintaining physical copies to be mailed to local law enforcement agencies. Penalties for non-compliance can include fines and suspension of firearms privileges. As noted in state-specific legislation, California has augmented federal requirements by mandating that all firearm sales be reported to state or local law enforcement, addressing legal gaps identified in existing federal regulations.


## Efficacy and Legal Challenges

Research indicates that firearm trafficking is significantly reduced when states implement monthly purchase limits. Virginia's adoption of a one-handgun-per-month law between 2012 and 2014 resulted in a 50% decrease in trafficked firearms recovered in the northern corridor. This disruption in illegal firearm transfers demonstrates the effectiveness of bulk purchase restrictions in undermining criminal activities.

The legal landscape surrounding these regulations continues to evolve. Gun Owners of California, Inc. has challenged the constitutionality of purchase restrictions, citing precedent from NYSRPA v. Bruen and arguing that modern purchase limits lack historical precedent when compared to founding-era laws. These legal battles focus primarily on constitutional scrutiny and the regulations' effectiveness in preventing gun trafficking.

Federal law mandates that firearm dealers report multiple sales to the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives, but this system has significant limitations, particularly in border regions. Traffickers can evade reporting requirements by purchasing firearms through different dealers within five business days. In response, California has implemented additional state-level measures requiring all firearm sales to be reported to state or local law enforcement, addressing these legal gaps.

The efficacy of these restrictions extends beyond individual states. Research from Washington demonstrates that prohibiting multiple firearm purchases reduces crime guns traced back to original sellers. The state's approach, which limits purchases to 30 days with exceptions for law enforcement and collectors, provides a model for disrupting patterns of bulk firearm acquisitions that facilitate criminal activity.


## Additional State and Local Regulations

Building on the foundation of state-level restrictions, California's proposed legislation would eliminate the private party transaction exemption for bulk firearm purchases, except in two specific circumstances - when the seller must relinquish all firearms under state law or court order, or when the transaction is part of an estate settlement or bequeathment in a will.

The bill's supporters point to rigorous supporting evidence. Studies show that handguns sold in multiple transactions (two or more firearms to the same purchaser within 5 business days) are 64% more likely to be used in crimes compared to individual purchases. Gun Trafficking Patterns Analysis demonstrates that 20-25% of crime scene handguns are purchased through multiple sales.

This legislative approach builds upon existing frameworks from successful states. Virginia's implementation of a one-handgun-per-month law resulted in a 50% reduction in trafficked firearms recovered in the northern corridor between 2012 and 2014, while maintaining public safety for lawful citizens seeking to sell firearms. Maryland and New Jersey have implemented similar restrictions but do not exempt bulk purchases from unlicensed sellers, providing a model for comprehensive state regulation.

The measure faces significant opposition from Gun Owners of California, Inc., primarily based on constitutional concerns following NYSRPA v. Bruen precedent. The organization argues that modern purchase restrictions lack historical precedent when compared to founding-era laws, while also raising concerns about burdening lawful citizens who wish to sell firearms. Despite this legal challenge, supporters maintain that these restrictions play a crucial role in disrupting patterns of bulk firearm acquisitions that facilitate criminal activity.
