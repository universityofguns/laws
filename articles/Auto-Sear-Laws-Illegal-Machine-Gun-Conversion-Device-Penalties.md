# Auto Sear Laws | Illegal Machine Gun Conversion Device Penalties

The unauthorized modification of firearms represents a growing threat to public safety, as semi-automatic weapons are increasingly converted into fully automatic firearms through the use of trigger activators and auto sears. These devices enable rapid-fire capabilities while circumventing existing regulations, making them particularly dangerous in the hands of unauthorized users. The legal landscape surrounding these conversion devices has evolved rapidly in recent years, with 27 states now banning them outright while the federal government continues to grapple with the issue. This article examines Virginia's comprehensive ban on auto sears and trigger activators, exploring the legal framework, penalties, and legislative trends that have shaped this evolving area of firearms regulation.


## Virginia's Ban on Auto Sear Devices

The Commonwealth of Virginia's ban on auto sears and trigger activators is codified in Virginia Code Section 18.2-308.5:1. This statute prohibits manufacture, importation, sale, and possession of these devices throughout the state. The definition of an auto sear is provided as a device "designed for use in converting semi-automatic firearm to shoot automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger."

Auto sears and trigger activators fall under the broader category of machine gun conversion devices, which are prohibited under federal law since 1934. While the federal definition includes any part "designed and intended solely and exclusively" for converting a weapon into a machine gun, Virginia law expands this to include parts designed for conversion even if not the sole purpose. This expanded definition brings the devices under the prohibition of both federal and state law.

Violations of Virginia's ban on auto sears are punished as Class 6 felonies. This stringent penalty reflects the state's determination to prevent modification of semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. The statute does not allow for legal exceptions based on possession of a valid Federal Firearms License, maintaining the prohibition across all contexts.

The ban extends protection to trigger activators, which are specifically defined as devices "designed to allow semi-automatic firearm to shoot more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger by harnessing recoil energy of firearm to which it is affixed, resetting trigger and continuing firing without additional physical manipulation by shooter." This comprehensive approach ensures that all devices enabling rapid-fire capabilities fall under the prohibition.

The enforcement of this statute has been reinforced through recent legislative actions in neighboring states. Tennessee is currently considering similar legislation, while Mississippi's evolving legal landscape continues to address the proliferation of these devices through both legislative and technological means.


## The National Firearms Act and Machine Gun Restrictions

Machine gun conversion devices, including auto sears and trigger activators, fall under the National Firearms Act of 1934, which restricts them through federal law. While civilians can legally own machine guns manufactured before 1986, these firearms must be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Newer machine guns and conversion devices are generally illegal, with exceptions for licensed dealers and manufacturers producing them for military or law enforcement use.

The Gun Control Act of 1968 expanded federal regulation by prohibiting the interstate transportation of firearms, including those converted to automatic or semi-automatic fire. This legislation required dealers to obtain Federal Firearms Licenses and established the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to enforce firearm regulations. The Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 further restricted new machinegun manufacture, though existing civilian machines must remain registered under the National Firearms Act.

The prohibition has faced significant challenges from technological advancements. The proliferation of 3D printing has enabled rapid production of auto sears and similar devices, with some costing as little as $20 and producing rapid-fire capabilities rivaling traditional machine guns. From 2012 to 2023, the ATF reported a 784% increase in recovered conversion devices, from 658 to 5,816 cases, with recovery spread across all 50 states and territories.

This technological challenge prompted legal action from both sides of the gun control debate. In 2017, the Trump administration achieved a settlement with the National Association for Gun Rights, legalizing Forced Reset Triggers that enable automatic fire. This decision suspended enforcement of machine gun designation and returned thousands of previously seized devices to owners, generating criticism from gun control advocates who argue it undermines decades of sensible policy.

The evolving legal landscape reflects broader tensions between technological innovation and regulatory adaptation. While federal law maintains prohibition, state-level actions demonstrate growing local concerns about conversion device proliferation. States like Alabama, New Mexico, and Virginia have enacted bans in recent years, highlighting how legislative approaches continue to evolve in response to changing technological capabilities and public safety considerations.


## Penalties for Violation

A violation of Virginia's ban on auto sear devices is classified as a Class 6 felony under the state's criminal code. This classification means that convicted offenders face maximum sentences of up to five years in prison and fines of up to $2,500. The law maintains this strict penalty structure regardless of whether the individual possessed parts intended for conversion or actually installed a prohibited device.

Penalties associated with federal law are significantly more severe, with possession of an illegal conversion device carrying maximum penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. These penalties apply to both the possession and manufacture of prohibited devices, though the exact enforcement approach may vary based on the scale of operation and other circumstances.

The legal framework supporting these penalties remains robust, even as federal policy underwent recent changes. In 2017, the Trump administration reached a settlement with the National Association for Gun Rights that temporarily suspended enforcement of machine gun designation rules, legalizing certain Forced Reset Triggers that enable automatic fire. However, this decision specifically pertained to the enforcement of machine gun classification rather than the broader prohibition on conversion devices.

Both state and federal penalties reflect the significant public safety concerns associated with these devices, which can convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of rapid fire. The widespread availability of these devices has prompted legislative action across multiple states, with Virginia, Alabama, New Mexico, and others implementing bans since 2023. These legislative responses demonstrate an ongoing effort to address the proliferation of conversion devices while maintaining legal clarity about firearm modification regulations.


## State-Level Bans and Enforcement

Alabama enacted its ban on auto sears following a mass shooting in Birmingham that left four people dead and 17 injured. The law, which became effective in 2024, makes it a felony to possess or sell any combination of parts intended to create an auto sear. Violators face up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine, with exemptions for law enforcement and individuals who register their firearms with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.

New Mexico's law, which took effect in the same year, imposes penalties of up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine for possession of a conversion device. The state's law has gained support from local law enforcement, including Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story, who highlighted growing concerns about juvenile crime and weapon modifications among teenagers.

The proliferation of these devices has prompted similar legislative actions across multiple states. Minnesota's new law significantly increases penalties for auto sear use, mandating up to 20 years in prison for violators. This response to documented increases in automatic gunfire reflects broader state-level efforts to address public safety concerns.

The number of states implementing bans has grown from 26 to 27, including Alabama and New Mexico. These bans typically fall under categories of machine gun conversion devices or rapid-fire trigger activators. The legislation exists alongside existing state machine gun prohibitions or as standalone regulations, demonstrating a trend toward more specific anti-weapon modification laws.

Law enforcement concerns about these devices are supported by federal data. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has reported a 784% increase in recovered conversion devices from 2012 to 2023, with recovery spread across all 50 states and territories. This expansion into more states indicates an ongoing need for legislative response to address the public safety implications of these weapon modification devices.


## Gun Rights vs. Gun Control Perspectives

While the federal government maintains prohibitions on machine guns and conversion devices since 1934, state-level bans have gained momentum in recent years. Alabama, which became the 26th state to enact such legislation, exemplifies this trend. Governor Kay Ivey signed the bill into law in March, making it a felony to possess or sell parts intended to create an auto sear. The legislation makes Alabama the first state to ban the devices outright, rather than requiring registration or other restrictions.

The legislative push has been driven by increased crime rates. In Alabama's case, this followed a mass shooting in Birmingham that utilized the devices, resulting in four deaths and 17 injuries. The state's action comes as 27 states now have bans in place, with similar legislation pending in Tennessee and other jurisdictions. The proliferation of these devices has prompted bipartisan support, though gun rights groups argue that existing federal restrictions are sufficient.

Alabama's law represents the most stringent approach to date, with penalties including up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. New Mexico's ban, which took effect in 2024, carries penalties of up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. These state-level actions reflect growing local concerns about weapon modifications and juvenile crime, as highlighted by Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story.

The debate centers on the effectiveness of state versus federal regulation. New Mexico's Senior Public Safety Adviser Ben Baker notes that state-level enforcement is crucial, as federal resources are insufficient for prosecuting cases, particularly involving juvenile offenders. This view is increasingly supported by local authorities, who see state bans as essential for addressing immediate public safety concerns.
