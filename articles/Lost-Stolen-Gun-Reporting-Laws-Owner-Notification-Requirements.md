# Lost and Stolen Gun Reporting Requirements in the United States

Gun trafficking and criminal use of stolen firearms pose significant public safety threats. However, addressing this issue requires robust reporting mechanisms. Federal law mandates firearm dealers report lost or stolen weapons within 48 hours, while states vary in their requirements for private owners. Research shows comprehensive reporting laws reduce traced illegal gun movements by 46% compared to jurisdictions without such regulations. Understanding these reporting requirements and their implications is crucial for effectively combating gun crime.


## Reporting Requirements for Gun Dealers


### Reporting Requirements for Gun Dealers

Federal law requires firearm dealers to report lost or stolen firearms to local law enforcement and the ATF within 48 hours of discovery. This process involves several key steps:

1. **Local Law Enforcement Notification**: After discovering a missing firearm, dealers must immediately notify local law enforcement. This initial report is crucial for recovering firearms involved in crimes, especially if the loss occurred during an inventory check.

2. **ATF Reporting**: Dealers must then contact the ATF's Stolen Firearms Program Manager at 1-800-930-9275. This call triggers the formal reporting process, which requires completing ATF Form 3310.11 and mailing it to the ATF's National Tracing Center.

3. **Secure Documentation**: Proper record-keeping is essential. Dealers must maintain detailed inventory records including serial numbers, make, model, caliber, and other descriptions. All communications and documentation related to lost or stolen firearms should be retained for compliance purposes.


### Reporting Process and Compliance

The ATF provides several reporting options for firearm dealers, including:

- **Phone Reporting**: Contacting the ATF's 24/7 toll-free line at 1-888-930-9275

- **Email Reporting**: Submitting reports to StolenFirearms@atf.gov

- **Fax Reporting**: Using designated numbers for faster processing

Non-compliance with these reporting requirements can result in severe penalties, including civil fines and potential license revocation. Law enforcement agencies may request serial numbers through formal written requests that must include specific identifying information about the case and the firearm in question.


### Legal Exceptions and Requirements

Firearm dealers are required to report lost or stolen firearms when they have actual knowledge of the incident. The reporting process includes:

- Notifying local law enforcement

- Completing ATF Form 3310.11

- Submitting detailed inventory information

- Maintaining complete records for investigation purposes

These requirements apply to all firearms, including NFA firearms, which must be reported separately to the NFA Branch upon discovery.


## Owner Reporting Requirements

The requirements vary by state, with most jurisdictions requiring reporting of all firearms within 5-7 days. Specific timelines range from immediate reporting (District of Columbia) to 72 hours (Massachusetts) or "forthwith" (Ohio). The report must include detailed information about the firearm, including caliber, make, model, manufacturer, serial number, and distinguishing marks.

The reporting process involves several steps:

1. Notifying the local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction

2. Submitting ATF Form 3310.11 to the National Tracing Center

3. Providing written confirmation of receipt from the receiving agency

4. Reporting firearm recovery within 7 days of recovery

Penalties for non-compliance are significant, with New York classifying the violation as a Class A misdemeanor. Other states may suspend or revoke firearm identification cards, while nationwide statistics show that failed reporting leads to increased gun trafficking and recovered guns used in crimes.


## Notification Requirements

Notification requirements for firearm owners vary by jurisdiction but typically mandate reporting both the loss and recovery of firearms. Under federal laws, any person, firm, or corporation owning a firearm must report any loss or theft within 48 hours of knowing or reasonably knowing about it. This report must be submitted to the appropriate law enforcement agency, which may be determined based on the location of the loss/theft or the owner's residence.

When reporting, owners must provide detailed information including the caliber, make, model, manufacturer, and serial number of the firearm, as well as any other distinguishing numbers or identifying marks. The receiving law enforcement agency is required to provide written confirmation of receipt for both the initial report and any subsequent recovery reports.

Several states have implemented stricter reporting requirements. New York requires immediate reporting to law enforcement for the loss or theft of handguns, rifles, or shotguns, with penalties including a Class A misdemeanor for non-compliance. Massachusetts law mandates reporting within 7 days to the State Police and local licensing authority, with penalties including suspension or permanent revocation of firearm identification cards for non-compliance.

Gun owners are also required to display prominent warning signs at their firearm retail locations. These warning signs must be displayed in block letters not less than one inch in height and must state, "FAILURE TO REPORT A LOST OR STOLEN FIREARM MAY RESULT IN [appropriate penalties specified by state law]."


## Penalties for Non-Compliance

The penalties for non-compliance with lost and stolen firearm reporting requirements vary by jurisdiction, ranging from fines to license revocation for firearm dealers, and criminal charges for private owners. Many states, including New York, California, and others, classify failure to report as a criminal offense, with penalties including class A misdemeanors and up to one year in jail.

The financial consequences of non-compliance can be severe, including civil fines and penalties that vary by state. New York law, for example, imposes a maximum fine of $1,000 for failing to report a lost or stolen firearm, while other states may assess fines of up to $5,000. The scope of liability extends beyond individual gun owners to firearm dealers and manufacturers, many of whom face potential license revocation for failing to report lost or stolen firearms from their inventory.

The legal framework underlying these penalties includes detailed statutory provisions. In New York, for instance, violating Penal Law § 400.10 can result in criminal charges for both public and private firearm owners. Similarly, Ohio law requires firearm owners to report lost or stolen weapons to the local licensing authority within 7 days, with violations potentially resulting in license suspension or revocation.

The broader implications of non-compliance extend beyond individual penalties to public safety. Studies have demonstrated that reporting lost and stolen firearms effectively reduces gun trafficking and criminal use of stolen weapons. States with comprehensive reporting requirements see a 46% reduction in traced illegal gun movements compared to jurisdictions without such laws, highlighting the systemic benefits of robust reporting mechanisms.


## Impact of Reporting Requirements

States with comprehensive lost and stolen firearm reporting laws have demonstrated significant reductions in gun trafficking and recovered guns used in crimes. Research indicates that these laws reduce traced illegal gun movement by 46% compared to states without such regulations.

From 2017 to 2021, there were 5,395 reported incidents of theft from licensed gun dealers, resulting in 34,339 firearms stolen. The theft problem is particularly concerning as approximately 380,000 guns are stolen from individual gun owners each year, with roughly 200,000 of these thefts reported to police—suggesting that nearly half of the guns lost or stolen in the United States are never reported to law enforcement.

The theft situation has worsened in recent years, with the number of guns reported stolen from individuals increasing by approximately 60% from 2006 to 2016. Many cities have experienced alarming spikes in car thefts. Nationally representative survey data indicates that 2.4% of U.S. gun owners have had at least one gun stolen in the past five years, with an average of 1.5 guns stolen per person.

Data shows that 79% of recovered stolen firearms were connected to crimes, including 1,500 violent acts. An analysis of crime scene firearms in Pittsburgh found nearly a third were stolen. Gun thefts from federal firearm licensees (FFLs) account for 53% of loss incidents and 58% of the total number of firearms reported lost and stolen. Of these losses, 17.3% of cases involved FFL thefts, 7.9% involved private person thefts, 0.6% involved common carrier thefts, and fewer than 0.1% involved law enforcement or military thefts.

Research from 1999-2002 indicates that 6.6% (7,758 of 117,138) of diverted firearms were stolen from residences or vehicles. A study linking Chicago Police Department theft data with crime guns recovered and traced showed that 3% of crime guns had previously been reported stolen. Between 2017 and 2021, firearms that were stolen from FFLs, private persons, common carriers, law enforcement, or the military were subsequently trafficked in 17.3%, 7.9%, 0.6%, and fewer than 0.1% of cases, respectively.
