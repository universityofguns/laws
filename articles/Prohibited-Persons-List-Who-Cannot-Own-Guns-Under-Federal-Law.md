# Federal Gun Laws: Prohibited Persons List

Federal gun laws establish clear parameters for firearm possession, but these regulations encompass a complex array of prohibited persons and specific firearms. The legal framework balances individual rights with public safety concerns through rigorous background checks and strict penalties for violations. Understanding these restrictions is crucial for law-abiding citizens, while individuals subject to these prohibitions face significant consequences for firearm possession. This article examines the legal landscape, including restrictions on aliens, convicted felons, individuals with mental health concerns, domestic violence prohibitions, and specific firearm types, providing essential guidance on federal gun law compliance.


## Aliens and Non-Citizens

According to federal law, aliens are prohibited from owning firearms in several specific circumstances: those who are illegally or unlawfully present in the United States, or those admitted under non-immigrant visas unless specifically exempted. The exemptions include individuals admitted for lawful hunting or sporting purposes, possessing a lawful hunting license or permit, serving as an official representative of a foreign government, or being a foreign law enforcement officer on official business.

The legal presence category also extends to refugees lawfully admitted to the United States. Those who receive a waiver from the United States Attorney are further included in this legal presence category. Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, aliens admitted under non-immigrant visas generally fall under federal prohibitions, except as explicitly provided for in specific subsections (y)(2).

The legal framework governing these restrictions includes comprehensive oversight mechanisms. The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) plays a crucial role in ensuring that individuals prohibited from firearm possession do not legally obtain firearms. This system operates within the broader framework of state background check procedures, with states having the authority to expand upon federal prohibitions in several key categories including felony convictions, domestic violence, and mental health.


## Convicted Felons and Dishonorably Discharged Veterans

Federal law prohibits firearm possession for individuals with convictions related to certain crimes of violence, including assault-related offenses, drug offenses, and domestic violence. The prohibited criminal category includes various misdemeanor offenses that may not be covered under federal law but are explicitly prohibited under state law.

The legal framework governing these restrictions includes comprehensive oversight through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which operates within the broader context of state background check procedures. While states can expand federal prohibitions in several key areas including felony convictions, domestic violence, and mental health, the primary federal statute addresses convictions that "involve ... the use or attempted use of physical force" against an "intimate partner or child."

The penalties for violating these restrictions are severe, with most prohibited persons facing up to 10 years imprisonment and a fine of $250,000. "Armed career criminals" - individuals with three or more convictions for serious drug offenses or felony crimes of violence - face mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years. The legal definition of "firearm" encompasses not only complete firearms but also specific components and modifications, such as fully automatic firearms and sawed-off shotguns.


## Mental Health Restriction Overview

Federal law prohibits firearm access to individuals determined by court, board, commission, or lawful authority to be a danger to themselves or others, or those found lacking mental capacity to contract or manage affairs due to mental condition or illness. Involuntary commitment to mental health or substance abuse treatment facilities falls under this prohibition, though short-term observation without longer-term commitment or court-ordered treatment is excluded.

The prohibition extends to individuals adjudicated as "mental defective" or committed to mental institutions, with the exception of those under 16 years old (where previously unspecified). State implementation varies: while most states mirror federal law regarding felony convictions and violent misdemeanor convictions, specific definitions and requirements differ between jurisdictions.

For example, Vermont requires a comprehensive mental health evaluation covering commitment history, violent behavior, medication management, and public safety risk before authorization for firearm possession can be restored. Other states implement similar requirements, with timeframes for reinstatement ranging from 3 to 10 years following commitment, depending on the individual's rehabilitation and competency assessment.

Recent legal developments clarify several aspects of mental health firearm restrictions. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 amended the Gun Control Act of 1968 to consider juvenile records in firearm sales restrictions. Additionally, federal law now explicitly applies to individuals 16 years or older who have been adjudicated as "mental defective" or committed to mental institutions.


## Domestic Violence and Protection Orders

Domestic violence restraining orders fall under federal regulation through Section 922(g)(8) of the Gun Control Act of 1968, which prohibits individuals subject to these orders from possessing firearms while the order is in effect. The prohibition applies regardless of whether the order emerged from a long-term or emergency phase, though individuals must have access to court proceedings during the emergency order phase to contest the firearm restriction.

The legal framework requires firearm removal in compliance with state procedures, which may vary significantly between jurisdictions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) plays a crucial role in enforcing these restrictions, though states have broad authority to adopt more stringent measures. As of 2023, at least 22 states explicitly authorize law enforcement to remove firearms from prohibited individuals, though only a few jurisdictions implement proactive mechanisms to ensure firearms are lawfully relinquished.


### Legal Requirements for Enforcement

Congress enacted these provisions to address domestic violence escalations into firearm homicides, with the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuting violations under Sections 922(g)(8) and 922(g)(9). To support these efforts, federal law requires states to implement risk-based removal procedures through extreme risk protection orders, allowing law enforcement or family/household members to petition courts when an individual poses a significant risk of harm to self or others.

The legal requirements for ยง 922(g)(9) convictions mandate proof of three specific elements: a previous conviction under federal, state, or tribal law, the use or attempted use of physical force, and an existing domestic relationship at the time of the offense. Penalties for violations typically range from 15 to 87 months in prison, with fines up to $250,000 possible for most prohibited persons in possession.

Recent legal developments have expanded these protections, with the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 amending the Gun Control Act of 1968 to consider juvenile records in firearm sales restrictions. Federal law now explicitly applies to individuals 16 years or older who have been adjudicated as "mental defective" or committed to mental institutions, further aligning federal standards with evolving legal interpretations.


## Additional Prohibitions and Exceptions

Federal law restricts firearm possession based on specific categories of prohibited persons, and these restrictions extend to particular firearm types and accessories. For example, individuals convicted of serious crimes, subject to domestic violence restraining orders, or determined by court to be a danger to themselves or others fall under these prohibitions.

The legal framework governing firearm types and accessories includes comprehensive oversight through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). The federal government maintains strict controls on certain firearm types and components, including specific modifications that render weapons classified as machine guns or large capacity ammunition feeding devices.

The law defines prohibited firearm types based on specific criteria. For instance, switchblade knives and gravity knives are prohibited for warden, superintendent, headkeeper, or deputy of state prisons, penitentiaries, workhouses, and county jails when performing official duty. However, these knives may be possessed for hunting, trapping, or fishing by individuals with valid licenses under the Environmental Conservation Law.

Rifles and shotguns may be possessed by U.S. citizens for hunting, trapping, or fishing with valid licenses under section 11-0713 of the environmental conservation law. Non-citizens similarly may possess these firearms under the same conditions. Individuals under 16 years of age may possess rifles or shotguns at shooting ranges under immediate supervision from commissioned officers, qualified adult U.S. citizens, parents, guardians, or designated individuals over 18 with hunter safety certificates.

The legal framework governing these restrictions includes the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which operates within the broader context of state background check procedures. States have the authority to establish additional restrictions, particularly regarding hunting and sporting purposes, though federal law provides specific guidelines for possession under these circumstances.

The legal requirements for compliance with these firearm restrictions mandate strict certification and supervision protocols for possession of specific firearm types. For example, individuals possessing air/gas/spring firearms under 12 years old must be supervised by commissioned military officers, qualified adult U.S. citizens with instructor certificates, or parent/guardians with written certification of responsible hunting, including safety, ethics, and landowner relations. Similarly, possession of these firearms by individuals under 16 years old requires direct supervision from specified personnel, including commissioned military officers or qualified adult citizens with instructor certificates.
