# Gun Purchase Waiting Period Laws by State

In the complex landscape of firearm regulations, waiting periods stand out as a pivotal policy tool that balances individual rights with public safety concerns. These requirements force a crucial pause between purchase and possession, during which authorities verify the buyer's eligibility to own a firearm. The duration and application of these waiting periods vary significantly from state to state, ranging from three to fourteen days, and their implementation has produced compelling evidence of effectiveness in reducing impulsive acts of gun violence and preventing suicides. This article examines the current state of firearm waiting period laws across the United States, explores their practical implications, and analyzes the policy's impact on gun violence, public safety, and responsible gun ownership.


## Waiting Period Laws by State

The implementation of waiting periods varies significantly across states. Six states and the District of Columbia impose waiting periods for all firearms, while four states apply waiting periods to specific classes of firearms, and another four states restrict waiting periods to handguns alone.

Waiting periods range from three to fourteen days, with some exceptions for law enforcement officials and life-threatening situations. California and the District of Columbia require a ten-day waiting period before buyers can take possession of new firearms. Hawaii mandates a 14-day permit process, while Minnesota implements a seven-day or five-business-day waiting period for handgun and assault weapon transfers.

The practical implications of these periods affect how quickly firearms change hands. In states like Florida and Colorado, which mandate a three-day waiting period, buyers must wait the longer of three days or the time it takes to complete a background check. Rhode Island's process varies from seven to fourteen days, depending on whether the buyer is a law enforcement official or not.

Minnesota represents an interesting case study, where the waiting period for handguns and assault weapons starts only after local law enforcement, typically a police chief or sheriff, completes their report. This can extend the waiting period, with exceptions available if there's a clear immediate danger.

Several states with licensing procedures require additional waiting periods. For example, Illinois mandates a 72-hour waiting period for all gun purchases requiring background checks, including those from dealers, private sellers, and gun shows. Similarly, Maine requires a 72-hour mandatory waiting period for all gun purchases that necessitate background checks.

Understanding these variations is crucial for compliance, particularly as the legal landscape continues to evolve. The software developed to manage these complexities demonstrates the challenges and the need for detailed, state-specific regulations. As of 2025, Washington requires ten business days for semiautomatic rifle purchases, while states like Maryland and New Jersey enforce seven-day waiting periods for handguns, starting from specific points in the application process.


## Impact on Gun Violence

According to multiple studies, firearm waiting periods have demonstrated effectiveness in two primary areas: reducing impulsive acts of gun violence and preventing suicides. Research indicates that states with waiting periods experience a significant reduction in firearm homicides â€“ specifically, a 17% decrease when the waiting period spans several days (Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence).

The cooling-off period appears particularly effective for impulsive gun violence, including suicides. Data shows that waiting periods can reduce firearm suicides by 7-11% (GIFFORDS), an improvement especially meaningful given firearms' 90% lethality rate compared to other suicide methods. The reduction primarily targets impulsive attempts, with studies noting most firearm suicides involve little planning, often less than 24 hours (Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence).

Waiting periods create a crucial gap between purchase and possession, which law enforcement can use to conduct background checks and prevent prohibited individuals from obtaining firearms. Current data estimates that 4,500 ineligible people successfully purchase firearms through "default proceed" sales annually (GIFFORDS).

The impact of waiting periods varies by implementation type. States with universal waiting periods (covering all firearms) experience greater reductions in firearm suicides and homicides compared to states with limited coverage (handgun only or specific classes) (Handgun Waiting Periods Reduce Gun Deaths). Research also indicates that extending background check completion times mirrors the effects of waiting periods, suggesting similar mechanisms of action (Handgun Waiting Periods Reduce Gun Deaths).

The policy's effectiveness holds across different time periods and legal contexts. A comprehensive study analyzing changes since 1970 found significant reductions in gun homicides while noting no increase in non-gun homicides (Handgun Waiting Periods Reduce Gun Deaths). This consistent impact suggests waiting periods can reduce firearm violence without unintended consequences.


## Implementation Statistics

As of 2025, six states and the District of Columbia impose waiting periods for all firearms, while four states apply waiting periods to specific classes of firearms, and four states restrict waiting periods to handguns only. These jurisdictions have implemented diverse waiting period lengths ranging from three to fourteen days, with some exceptions for law enforcement officials and life-threatening situations.

The practical implementation of these laws varies significantly across states. For instance, California and the District of Columbia mandate a ten-day waiting period before buyers can take possession of new firearms. Hawaii requires 14 days for firearm purchases, while Minnesota implements a seven-day or five-business-day waiting period for handgun and assault weapon transfers. Other states have implemented shorter waiting periods, with Maine and Washington requiring 72 hours for semiautomatic rifle purchases.

This implementation has led to notable differences in the time between purchase and transfer. The variations affect how quickly firearms change hands, with some jurisdictions requiring the longer of three days or background check completion times, while others like Rhode Island allow delivery within seven days for law enforcement members.

Understanding these implementation details is crucial for compliance, particularly as the legal landscape continues to evolve. As of 2025, Washington requires ten business days for semiautomatic rifle purchases, while states like Maryland and New Jersey enforce seven-day waiting periods for handguns, starting from specific points in the application process. This demonstrates the ongoing development and adaptation of these regulations across different states.


## Public Support

The policy enjoys widespread public support, with 85% of non-gun owners and 72% of gun owners favoring mandatory waiting periods. This broad backing aligns with the practical benefits these laws provide, as supported by multiple studies.

Research indicates that waiting periods can address impulsive behaviors, with significant reductions in firearm-related incidents. States with waiting period laws experienced a staggering 51% decrease in firearm suicides compared to states without such provisions. This effectiveness extends to gun homicides, where waiting periods were associated with a 17% reduction in firearm-related fatalities.

The support for waiting periods transcends partisan lines, with 75% of Americans favoring a 30-day waiting period for firearm purchases. This level of public backing reflects the policy's potential to address both public safety concerns and responsible gun ownership practices.


## Policy Details

The federal government does not mandate waiting periods for firearm purchases, instead relying on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which typically clears background checks within three business days. Under current law, licensed dealers may transfer firearms immediately after a background check is passed, unless prohibited individuals are identified. This "default proceed" rule allows for rapid firearm transfers while federal agencies conduct supplementary reviews.

State laws vary significantly in both implementation and duration. California and the District of Columbia require ten-day waiting periods for all firearm purchases. Hawaii mandates a 14-day permit process, while Minnesota implements a seven-day or five-business-day waiting period for handgun and assault weapon transfers. Rhode Island allows delivery within seven days for law enforcement members, with shorter periods for background checks showing no disqualification.

Waiting periods vary from one to 30 days across the states implementing them. Some states, like Florida and Colorado, mandate a three-day waiting period, while others like New Mexico require seven days for non-concealed carry permit holders. Minnesota's process starts only after local law enforcement reports, with exceptions available for immediate safety threats. California and the District of Columbia enforce their ten-day requirement across all firearm purchases.

The implementation of these laws affects how quickly firearms change hands. States like Florida require the longer of three days or background check completion times, while Rhode Island allows delivery within seven days for law enforcement members. Washington requires ten business days for semiautomatic rifle purchases, while Maryland enforces a seven-day waiting period specifically for handguns, starting when applications are submitted to the state police.

Understanding these variations is crucial for compliance, particularly as legal landscapes continue to evolve.
