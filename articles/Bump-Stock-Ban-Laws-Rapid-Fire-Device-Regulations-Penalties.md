# Bump Stock Ban Laws: The Legal Battle Over Rapid Fire Device Regulations

The legal battle over bump stocks has evolved dramatically since their controversial role in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. These devices enable semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly, raising serious public safety concerns. Federal regulators initially classified bump stocks as legal firearm accessories, but the 2018 mass shooting sparked a reinterpretation that treated them as machine guns—until the Supreme Court struck down this ban in 2024. The resulting legal landscape creates a patchwork of state regulations, with some states maintaining bans while others face challenges enforcing restrictions. The Supreme Court's decision has significant implications for firearm legislation and public safety policy nationwide.


## The 2017 Las Vegas Shooting and Bump Stocks

In 2017, a gunman killed 58 people and injured over 800 during a concert in Las Vegas using a device known as a "bump stock" (or "bump fire stock"). Thirteen of his 18 rifles had such equipment, according to law enforcement officials. The use of these devices in the mass shooting demonstrated their potential for rapid-fire capability. The tragic event led to significant public debate and legislative action regarding the regulation of bump stocks.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) previously stated that bump stocks are firearm accessories and determined they are not machine guns subject to regulation under federal law. These devices enable semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly, with some capable of discharging between 400-800 rounds per minute. The firearm industry developed bump stocks to circumvent existing machine gun restrictions, allowing assault weapons to be modified for increased shooting efficiency.

Following the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the federal government took action to address the issue. In March 2018, President Donald Trump instructed the Department of Justice to treat bump stocks as machine guns, effectively banning them under existing federal law. The ATF supported this classification through its final rule issued on December 18, 2018, which went into effect on March 26, 2019. This regulation required owners to destroy or surrender bump stocks, subjecting violations to penalties of up to $250,000 fine and ten years imprisonment.

However, the legal landscape surrounding bump stocks faced significant changes in 2024 with the Supreme Court's decision in Garland v. Cargill. The Court determined that the government did not have the right to ban bump stocks, ruling that a semi-automatic rifle with an attachment does not qualify as a machine gun under federal law. The Court's interpretation was based on the statutory text, finding that these devices do not fire "more than one shot by a single function of the trigger." Instead, a shooter must release and reset the trigger between every shot for subsequent shots to be fired.

The Supreme Court's decision impacts 34 states, with 16 states having their own laws specifically banning possession of bump stocks. While many other states have broad machine gun and conversion device bans, the ruling leaves the legal status of bump stocks in question for those states without specific regulations. The decision has opened the door for legal challenges to existing state bans, though it has also garnered bipartisan support with several Republican governors signing legislation to ban these devices nationwide.


## Federal Regulation Attempt: 2018 ATF Rule

The ATF's change in position regarding bump stocks followed a pattern established during both Republican and Democratic administrations. The bureau had previously ruled these devices were not machine guns subject to regulation under federal law, a stance maintained from 2002 to 2017 when the Akins Accelerator was initially classified similarly but later reinterpreted as a machine gun in 2006.

Following the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and the subsequent President Trump directive, the ATF amended its regulations to explicitly classify bump stocks as machine guns. This reclassification was based on the administration's interpretation that the devices met the legal definition of machine guns under the National Firearms Act, specifically qualifying as firearm accessories that transform semi-automatic weapons into automatic firing mechanisms.

The regulatory process culminated in an extensive rulemaking period, with over 119,000 public comments supporting the ban and 66,000 opposing it. The final regulation, issued on December 18, 2018, required owners to destroy or surrender bump stocks within 90 days of the rule's effective date of March 26, 2019. This action officially classified approximately 220,000 to 520,000 such devices then in circulation across the country, though the ATF ultimately received only 680 returned devices, indicating significant non-compliance.

The legal challenges to this federal ban spanned multiple jurisdictions, with the 5th and 6th Circuit Courts of Appeals initially upholding the regulation before the Supreme Court's June 14, 2024 decision in Garland v. Cargill struck it down. The Court's rationale centered on the statutory language of the National Firearms Act, determining that bump stocks did not meet the legal definition of machine guns as firearms that can fire "more than one shot by a single function of the trigger." This interpretation, aligned with the "rule of lenity" in ambiguous criminal statutes, marked a significant policy shift impacting firearm regulations across the United States.


## State-Level Bans

In the wake of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, several states took action to address the loophole in existing firearm regulations that permitted bump stocks. As of 2024, thirteen states and the District of Columbia have enacted specific legislation banning these devices, though the Supreme Court's decision has impacted the legal landscape.

California led the way in 1990 with its prohibition on bump stocks, followed by New York's implementation of its SAFE Act in 2013 with further clarifications in 2019. Other states followed suit, with comprehensive bans in place by 2018. Michigan, Minnesota, and Puerto Rico have legal status ambiguities regarding bump stocks, while New Jersey banned them in January 2018 and Vermont enacted similar legislation later that year.

The remaining states in this group—Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Washington, and the District of Columbia—also prohibit bump stocks through broad machine gun and conversion device bans. Local jurisdictions have also taken action, with Northbrook, Illinois implementing a ban in April 2018 and Boulder, Colorado following suit in May of the same year.

International comparisons show that while the United Kingdom banned bump stocks through its Offensive Weapons Act 2019, Australia implemented an import ban in November 2019. The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, led by Rep. Mike Thompson, has continued to advocate for federal legislation, with Rep. Dina Titus' discharge petition for the Closing the Bump Stock Loophole Act (H.R. 396) seeking to address the Supreme Court's decision and bring bump stocks under federal regulation.

These state-level bans reflect a range of legislative approaches, from outright prohibition to inclusion within existing machine gun regulations. The patchwork of state laws highlights the ongoing debate over firearm regulations and public safety in the aftermath of mass shootings.


## Supreme Court Decision and Its Impact

The Supreme Court's decision in Garland v. Cargill represented a significant legal reversal, striking down the federal ban on bump stocks as invalid under federal law. The Court's ruling was based on its interpretation of the statutory text, determining that bump stocks did not meet the legal definition of machine guns—specifically firearms that can fire "more than one shot by a single function of the trigger." This interpretation aligned with the "rule of lenity," a legal principle that ambiguous criminal statutes are construed most favorably to defendants.

The Court's decision had immediate repercussions for state-level regulations. While 13 states and the District of Columbia had enacted bans based on their own legislation, the Supreme Court ruling invalidated the federal ban for the remaining 34 states. This created a legal landscape where states with specific bump stock bans (16 states) retained their regulations, while other states with broader machine gun bans maintained their restrictions. However, many states faced the prospect of legal challenges to their existing bans, particularly those lacking specific language addressing bump stocks.

The ruling received significant attention from both firearm advocates and opponents. The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported greater restrictions on bump stocks, though other gun groups subsequently filed legal challenges to the ATF's ban. Notably, several Republican governors in states with existing bans—Massachusetts, Florida, Maryland, and Vermont—responded by signing legislation to ban these devices. The bipartisan Banning Unlawful Machinegun Parts (BUMP) Act, introduced by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), sought to address the legal ambiguity by prohibiting the sale of bump stocks and similar devices.


### Current Legal Status and Future Prospects

The immediate legal status of bump stocks remains complex. While federal law no longer prohibits their possession, 15 states and the District of Columbia maintain bans based on their specific legislation. This patchwork of regulations has created challenges for law enforcement and gun owners, particularly as states face varying legal pressures to either enforce existing bans or modify their regulations. The future of bump stock legislation remains uncertain, with the Supreme Court's decision opening new legal avenues for both advocates and opponents to shape national firearms policy.


## Current LegalStatus and Future Prospects

As a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Garland v. Cargill, bump stocks are now legal to buy and possess in many states across the country. While 15 states and the District of Columbia maintain bans based on their specific legislation, the federal ban no longer applies to the remaining 34 states. This means that the gun industry can resume manufacturing similar devices, though states without specific bump stock bans will find that these devices are legal under current federal law.

Slide Fire Solutions, the company responsible for creating and selling bump stocks, initially suspended sales following the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. They resumed sales shortly after the ATF's 2018 ban and subsequently halted manufacturing following the 2018 Parkland high school shooting, despite the absence of bump stocks in that incident. The company has now announced plans to resume production of bump fire stocks in compliance with the Supreme Court ruling.

The legal landscape continues to evolve through legislative action at both the state and federal levels. While some Republican governors have signed legislation to ban these devices nationwide, the Supreme Court's decision allows Congress to pursue new legislation clarifying the legal status of bump stocks. The Banning Unlawful Machinegun Parts (BUMP) Act, introduced by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), would prohibit the sale of bump stocks and similar devices. The bill has garnered 27 additional cosponsors since its introduction, demonstrating growing bipartisan interest in addressing this legal ambiguity.
