# Minimum Age Requirements for Gun Purchase: Federal and State Laws

The legal landscape surrounding firearm purchases in the United States is complex and multifaceted, with federal regulations providing a baseline that is frequently supplemented or amended by state laws. While the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 established minimum age requirements for purchasing firearms, it has left significant room for variation at the state level. These age restrictions have implications not only for who can legally purchase guns but also shape broader discussions about gun control, constitutional rights, and public policy. The evolving legal landscape has seen several recent developments, from states raising purchasing ages to federal court rulings on the scope of Second Amendment protections for young adults. Understanding these age requirements is crucial for policymakers, law enforcement, and citizens alike as this legal framework continues to evolve.


## Federal Law on Gun Purchase Age

The Gun Control Act of 1968 establishes minimum age requirements for firearm purchases, with federal standards serving as a baseline for state regulations. For long guns (shotguns and rifles), the federal minimum age is 18 years old. The minimum age to purchase handguns is 21 years old, with some states operating under stricter requirements than federal law mandates. As of February 2024, 13 states and the District of Columbia impose a minimum age of 21 for handgun purchases, while 23 states have enacted laws closing the gap between federal requirements and state gun purchase ages through various exceptions. These states typically allow individuals between 18 and 20 years old to purchase long guns with some restrictions.

The federal framework specifically prohibits firearm dealers from selling handguns to persons under 21, while allowing individuals between 18 and 20 to purchase them from unlicensed sellers within their state. Exceptions to this rule exist for certain activities, including employment, ranching, farming, target practice, and hunting, provided written consent from a parent or guardian who is not prohibited from possession under federal, state, or local law. Additionally, military service members and National Guard members under 21 may possess firearms in the line of duty, and juveniles may temporarily possess handguns and ammunition under specific circumstances, such as taking action in defense of themselves or others against an intruder.

State regulations further modify these federal parameters. For instance, in Alaska, the handgun possession age has been reduced to 16 years old, while Louisiana permits handgun purchases at 17 years old. Some states have tailored legislation to address particular concerns, such as Florida's recent proposals to adjust purchasing ages and New York's stringent requirements that prohibit anyone under 21 from acquiring a firearm without a permit, except in specific circumstances where they may carry, fire, or use rifles or shotguns under parental supervision.

The legal landscape continues to evolve through judicial decisions that interpret the Second Amendment. In a significant ruling by the U.S. appeals court in the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit, the court established that 18- to 20-year-olds enjoy protection under the Second Amendment, challenging the federal government's ability to restrict their handgun purchases. This interpretation aligns with decisions from other circuit courts that have ruled against age restrictions in recent years, potentially setting the stage for Supreme Court review of these regulations.


## State Variations in Gun Purchase Age

The federal framework mandates that individuals under 21 years old may purchase handguns from unlicensed sellers within their state, while licensed dealers are prohibited from selling handguns to persons under that age. The legal landscape varies significantly by state regarding private purchases, with 23 states allowing those between 18 and 21 to purchase handguns in private sales. Some states have established even stricter age requirements for handgun purchases, including Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, D.C., where the minimum age is 21.

For long gun purchases, federal law sets no minimum age requirement for sales by unlicensed sellers. However, 23 states have enacted laws to partially close the gap between federal requirements and state gun purchase ages, imposing a minimum age for possession. Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Illinois, Florida, Delaware, and California have age restrictions above the federally mandated purchasing age. In the case of private sales, Kentucky has no minimum age requirement, while many jurisdictions have local ordinances that restrict firearm sales to minors despite state laws.

The age requirements for specific firearm types can also vary by state. For instance, in Alaska, the handgun possession age has been reduced to 16 years old, while Louisiana permits handgun purchases at 17 years old. States like Colorado recently increased the age to 21 for handgun purchases, while Florida has proposed legislation to decrease the age. The legal system continues to evolve, with significant changes occurring in recent years. In a notable ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Edith H. Jones ruled that 18- to 20-year-olds are protected by the Second Amendment, challenging the federal government's ability to restrict their handgun purchases. This decision reflects a broader trend in circuit court rulings against age restrictions, with the potential for Supreme Court review.


## Private Sales and Age Requirements

Federal law allows certain private sales to individuals between 18 and 21, but state regulations further define the circumstances under which minors can purchase firearms. In general, unlicensed dealers may sell handguns to individuals between 18 and 21 years old if the buyer is not otherwise prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal law.

According to state laws, 23 states permit those between 18 and 21 to purchase handguns through private sales, though each state maintains unique regulations. For example, Alabama requires individuals under 19 to have parental consent for firearm transfers and prohibits transfers to minors under 19. In Alaska, minors as young as 16 can possess firearms with parental consent, though the state's specific purchasing age regulations are not fully detailed in the available documents.

The legal landscape varies significantly regarding ammunition sales. While federal law does not explicitly address ammunition purchases for individuals under 21, several states have implemented specific restrictions. For instance, California and New York prohibit ammunition sales to individuals under 21, while other states like Texas prohibit ammunition sales to minors under 18 without parental consent.

It's important to note that local ordinances may further restrict firearm sales to minors, even in states where age restrictions are relaxed. Dealers must verify the buyer's age and ensure they are not prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal law before completing a private sale. The legal system continues to evolve, with recent developments clarifying some aspects of state and federal regulations regarding firearm purchases and possession by minors.


## Age Requirements for Specific Firearms

According to federal law, individuals 21 years of age or older may purchase handguns from licensed dealers. For rifles and shotguns, the minimum age requirement is 18 years old when purchasing from licensed dealers. The law explicitly prohibits licensed firearm dealers from selling handguns or handgun ammunition to individuals under 18 years old, while setting no age minimum for purchasing long guns (rifles and shotguns) from unlicensed sellers.

The legal landscape varies significantly by state, with many jurisdictions implementing stricter age requirements than federal law mandates. In states like Arizona, Arkansas, and Georgia, individuals 18 years old may purchase handguns, though this age is three years below the federal minimum for handgun purchases. Some states, such as Florida, have recently increased their minimum age for handgun purchases to 21, aligning more closely with federal standards.

Handgun regulations are particularly complex, with federal law allowing individuals between 18 and 21 to purchase handguns from unlicensed sellers within their state, provided the buyer is not otherwise prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal law. However, state regulations can further restrict these transactions. For example, Connecticut requires a purchase certificate for individuals 18 and older, who can then purchase long guns but not handguns. Similarly, Rhode Island maintains a 21-year-old minimum age for all firearm purchases, while New York requires a permit-to-purchase for handgun purchases while allowing 18- to 20-year-olds to possess firearms under certain conditions.

The legal system continues to evolve through judicial precedents, with circuit courts increasingly ruling against age restrictions in recent years. The U.S. appeals court in the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit established that 18- to 20-year-olds enjoy protection under the Second Amendment, challenging federal government restrictions on handgun purchases for this age group. Similar rulings from other circuit courts reflect growing legal challenges to existing age requirements.


## Exceptions and Prohibited Individuals

Federal law explicitly prohibits firearm dealers from selling handguns or handgun ammunition to individuals under 18 years old, while establishing that individuals 21 years of age or older may purchase handguns from licensed dealers. For rifles and shotguns, the minimum age requirement is 18 years old when purchasing from licensed dealers. The law explicitly prohibits licensed firearm dealers from selling handguns or handgun ammunition to individuals under 18 years old, while setting no age minimum for purchasing long guns (rifles and shotguns) from unlicensed sellers.

Firearms regulation extends beyond purchasing requirements, with specific restrictions on prohibited individuals. Under federal law, those barred from possessing firearms include undocumented immigrants, convicted felons, fugitives, individuals with active court protective orders or restraining orders, those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors, drug users, and individuals declared mentally unfit due to illness. These restrictions apply regardless of age, though purchasing requirements vary based on firearm type and dealer status. For example, while handgun purchases are restricted to individuals 21 years old or older, state laws may allow those between 18 and 20 to possess firearms under certain circumstances, such as employment, ranching, or hunting with parental consent.
