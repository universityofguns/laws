# Machine Gun & .50 Caliber Rifle Laws | NFA Weapon Regulations

Machine guns and .50 caliber rifles represent the apex of military-grade weaponry, combining industrial-strength lethality with technical sophistication. Yet, these powerful firearms exist in a legal limbo defined by complex federal regulations and patchwork state laws. As we examine the legal framework governing these weapons, we discover a system where acquisition requires more paperwork than a small business opening, and possession triggers strict storage requirements that would make most homeowners recoil in frustration. This article unravels the convoluted regulations surrounding these weapons, from the $200 transfer tax required by the National Firearms Act to the precise torch-cutting techniques mandated for their destruction. Through this exploration, we uncover how government agencies, private citizens, and firearm manufacturers navigate a legal landscape that simultaneously seeks to control these deadly weapons while preserving the rights of their lawful owners.


## Prohibition of Machine Guns and .50 Caliber Rifles

According to the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, machine guns and .50 caliber rifles fall under strict regulations governing their manufacture, import, sale, transfer, and possession. Importing these weapons requires obtaining ATF Form 6, while manufacturers and importers must file Form 2 for registration.

The legislative framework treats the conveyance of these firearms to licensed contractors for inspection, testing, or repair through an approved alternate procedure. This method requires a temporary import license (DSP-61) from the Department of State or compliance with 22 CFR 123.4 exemptions.

The National Firearms Act imposes a $200 tax on each transfer and requires specific marking and identifying details for registration. Federal law prohibits most private transfers and possession unless the weapon was in circulation before May 19, 1986. Only federally licensed manufacturers, importers, dealers, or collectors can conduct interstate transfers.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives maintains centralized records of these firearms, and law enforcement certification is required to verify compliance with state and local laws before approving transfers. Federally licensed entities must obtain sworn statements from recipients explaining their need for the firearm and confirming public safety compliance.


## Machine Gun Regulations

The regulations surrounding machine guns under the National Firearms Act (NFA) impose several key requirements. Machine gun manufacturers, importers, and dealers must register with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) as Class 1, 2, or 3 licensees, with annual special occupational taxes ranging from $1,000 to $500 based on gross receipts. Importers and manufacturers with annual receipts under $500,000 can reduce their tax obligation to $500.

Machine guns can only be brought into the country for sale/distribution to federal, state, or local government agencies or registered dealers. Export regulations mandate that weapons be transported out of the United States within six months of obtaining an export permit, which must be renewed annually. The process requires detailed documentation about governmental customers, availability, model interest, and dealer needs.

All machine guns must be registered with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, with each weapon requiring a unique serial number. The law imposes specific marking and identifying requirements, and requires businesses to maintain ATF records of transactions. Transfers between civilians, even for those possessing pre-1986 weapons, must be approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives and updated in the registration records.


## .50 Caliber Rifle Regulations

The legal landscape surrounding .50 caliber rifles presents significant regulatory challenges. Federal law maintains an extremely permissive stance, allowing pre-1986 models while prohibiting possession of manufactured or imported weapons since that time. Ownership requires mere compliance with basic federal standards—such as passing a background check and meeting age requirements—but state and local jurisdictions vary dramatically in their approach.

California leads in restrictive measures, banning manufacture, possession, and private sale while requiring registration for existing weapons. Other states like Illinois and Connecticut have enacted regulations prohibiting commerce while allowing private possession with severe restrictions. The legal status remains unclear in many areas, particularly regarding ammunition regulation and civilian ownership of newer models.

Technical aspects of regulation present additional complexities. While federal law permits possession of certain older models, the definition of "weapon" in legislative contexts remains sufficiently broad to encompass trigger-activating modifications. The potential lethality of these weapons further complicates regulation, with documented capabilities to penetrate aircraft and armor at extended ranges. This technical advantage has spurred legislative proposals to address both the weapon itself and its ammunition, though no definitive solution has emerged at the federal level.


## Machine Gun Destruction Requirements

The destruction of machinegun receivers requires specific methods to ensure the weapon cannot be restored to operable condition. The preferred method uses a cutting torch with a tip that displaces at least one-quarter inch of material at each cut location, making three diagonal cuts through designated areas of the receiver. Alternative methods must be approved by the ATF Firearms Technology Branch and typically involve saw cutting and disposing of certain removed portions.

The destruction process begins with cutting the threaded portion of the receiver ring and magazine well opening at the bottom. The return spring cap socket and sear slot in the lower side of the receiver also require complete severing through diagonal torch cuts. The cutting must reach a depth sufficient to prevent the weapon's future use as a firearm, with the ATF requiring verification of complete severance in designated areas.

Machinegun silencers face similar destruction requirements, mandating complete severing of all components to prevent future use as a firearm suppression device. The process must be performed using methods equivalent to the approved torch cutting technique, with written approval required for alternative methods.


## Legal Status and Possession Requirements

Machine gun ownership requires stringent federal regulation and specific legal criteria. The transfer of machine guns from existing stock is permitted under certain conditions, primarily to governmental entities or those who legally possessed them before May 19, 1986. All transfers must be approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (ATF).

Ownership eligibility is heavily restricted, excluding felons, convicts, fugitives, drug users, mental health patients, illegal aliens, military members with dishonorable discharges, and citizens who have renounced their U.S. citizenship. Background checks are mandatory through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and individuals must pass a convicted persons check to verify eligibility.

The legal path to acquisition is lengthy and costly, with the required ATF Form 4 registration process often taking several months. Each purchase requires specific documentation and documentation verification, including sworn statements explaining the need for the firearm. Machine gun owners must maintain detailed records and adhere to strict storage and transport requirements.

Five states - Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and New Mexico - currently have no specific state-level regulations governing machine guns. Twenty-five states impose criminal penalties for unauthorized manufacture, possession, or sale in violation of federal law. The remaining 35 states have minimal or no state-level regulations governing these weapons.

The legal landscape for .50 caliber rifles varies significantly by state. California leads restrictive measures, banning manufacture, possession, and private sale while requiring registration for existing weapons. Other heavily restrictive states include Connecticut and Illinois, which prohibit commercial activity while allowing private possession under severe conditions. The legal status remains unclear in many areas, particularly regarding ammunition regulation and civilian ownership of newer models.
