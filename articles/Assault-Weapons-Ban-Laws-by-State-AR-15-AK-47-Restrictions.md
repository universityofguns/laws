# State-Level Assault Weapons Bans: Examining the Legal Landscape

In the shadow of tragic mass shootings, state legislatures across America have begun to address the proliferation of assault weapons through comprehensive bans on specific firearm types. Ten states now restrict more than 50 technical variations of semiautomatic rifles, while nine others prohibit the sale and manufacture of particular weapons. However, these piecemeal regulations face significant legal challenges and preemption from state legislatures, leaving gun owners and policymakers navigating a complex landscape of rights and responsibilities. This article examines the legal frameworks behind state-level assault weapons bans, from Washington's technical restrictions to the federal ban's legacy and the ongoing legislative efforts to address this pressing public safety issue.


## Washington State's Assault Weapons Ban

The state's ban restricts more than 50 specific types of semiautomatic firearms, including AR-15s, that meet certain technical criteria. Under the law, these weapons cannot be sold, manufactured, or distributed in Washington state. The ban covers:

- Rifles under 30 inches in overall length

- Semi-automatic centerfire rifles with specific features like:

  * Pistol grip

  * Thumbhole stock

  * Folding or telescoping stock

  * Forward pistol grip

  * Flash suppressor, flash guard, or flash hider

  * Muzzle brake or recoil compensator

  * Grenade launcher or flare launcher

  * Barrel shroud covering all or part of the barrel

Additional restrictions apply to semi-automatic centerfire rifles with fixed magazines over 10 rounds. The law also prohibits possession of certain components that enable assault weapon functionality, including conversion kits and parts.

The ban took effect immediately upon signatures from Governor Jay Inslee, making Washington the 10th state to implement such restrictions. The legislation follows a pattern seen in other states, which have defined assault weapons through specific technical features rather than broad categorical descriptions.


## Historical Context: Federal Assault Weapons Ban

The Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 represented a significant legislative effort to address weapons of concern, though its impact was limited by design flaws. The ban applied to 19 specific semiautomatic weapons and any firearm with two or more "military-style" features, including pistol grips, folding stocks, and flash suppressors.

The legislation's implementation was complicated by a loophole that allowed manufacturers to increase production before the ban's effective date. The ban's sunset provision expired in 2004, and its repeal came under significant scrutiny for enabling a dramatic increase in assault weapon proliferation. Between 2004 and 2013, annual production surged from 100,000 to 2 million units, significantly expanding the national arsenal of AR-style firearms.

Despite the ban's expiration, its legacy persisted in preventing 30 mass shootings and 1,478 related casualties between 2005 and 2019, according to research estimates. The federal ban's impact extended beyond direct regulation, setting a precedent that influenced subsequent state-level legislation and shaping public policy debates around firearm regulation.

Current legislative efforts seek to address these limitations through stricter definitions and broader coverage. The 2022 House-passed Assault Weapons Ban, for example, seeks to define and prohibit specific classes of semi-automatic firearms while maintaining existing legal protections for law enforcement and licensed firearm owners.


## State-by-State Restrictions

From California to Washington, ten states have enacted comprehensive assault weapons bans, while nine states prohibit the sale, manufacture, and distribution of specific types of semiautomatic firearms. These laws typically target weapons with detachable magazines and technical features that enable rapid-fire capabilities. Most states, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, define assault weapons based on specific technical criteria rather than generic categories.

The legal landscape varies significantly between states. For instance, California restricts weapons that are semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines or fixed magazine capacities over ten rounds. New York's definition includes semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines plus two or more military-style features, such as bayonet mounts or flash suppressors. New Jersey's restrictions mirror New York's, with additional specific features and firearm model names prohibited.

Notably, some states maintain more lenient regulations on AR-15 variants. Texas, Arizona, and Alaska have no specific classification for assault weapons and no magazine capacity limits. Private sales, including those at gun shows, generally require only federal background checks in these states unless local municipalities have enacted stricter regulations. Under current federal law, firearms including AR-15 variants face jurisdictional requirements from the Department of State or Department of Commerce, particularly for export purposes.

The piecemeal legislative approach has proven insufficient in addressing the dangers posed by assault weapons, as evidenced by the continued proliferation of mass shootings involving these weapons. Statistics demonstrate that mass shootings with assault weapons result in nearly six times more shooting victims and over twice as many fatalities compared to those without such weapons. Legislative efforts continue at both state and federal levels to address these pressing public safety concerns.


## Legal Challenges and Preemption

Local municipalities face significant legal limitations when attempting to enforce stricter gun control measures, with state preemption laws playing a crucial role in determining the scope of local regulation. While several cities have succeeded in implementing comprehensive ordinances, the success of local policies depends heavily on preemption statutes.

In Illinois, for example, Chicago and Cook County have established local regulations, though state law allows preemption if broader legislation is enacted. Similarly, Indiana's 2011 preemption legislation invalidated both Gary and East Chicago city council ordinances, demonstrating how state policy can preempt local enforcements.

At the federal level, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA) of 1986 establishes a framework for interstate firearm transportation while protecting gun owners' rights. Under FOPA, firearms can be transported between legal possession locations as long as they remain unloaded and inaccessible, with brief stops for refueling or meals considered incidental. The journey requires firearms and ammunition to be in a locked container if the vehicle lacks a separate driver's area, ensuring compliance with both federal and state regulations.

The legal landscape varies significantly between states. While some, like California and New York, maintain robust local regulation frameworks, others face more stringent preemption statutes. This piecemeal approach has proven insufficient in addressing the proliferation of assault weapons, with recent studies estimating that 30 mass shootings would have been prevented between 2005 and 2019 had the federal ban remained in effect.

The continued debate over gun control balances Second Amendment rights with public safety concerns. Current legislative efforts focus on expanding background check requirements, restricting magazine capacities to ten rounds, and enhancing red flag laws. Understanding these regulations requires gun owners to stay informed about evolving laws at all government levels, while organizations like the National Rifle Association work to counteract stricter gun control measures.


## The Future of Assault Weapons Legislation

The legislative landscape regarding assault weapons remains complex and evolving. Federal efforts have seen limited success; while the House passed a ban bill in 2022, the Senate has not acted, and the measure lacks the 60 votes needed to overcome a potential filibuster.

The 2023 Assault Weapon Ban, introduced as the GOSAFE Act, takes a multi-pronged approach to regulation. This legislation would define assault weapons based on specific technical features and prohibit their manufacture, sale, transfer, or possession. Grandfathered weapons and magazines already in lawful possession would remain allowable, while limiting magazine capacities to 10 rounds.

The proposed ban would target 205 military-style assault weapons by name while outlawing any weapon that accepts detachable magazines and possesses one or more military characteristics. This approach builds on previous legislative attempts to address the technical definitions that have hindered effective regulation.

Support for these measures remains significant, with 63% of Americans favoring assault weapon bans. Grassroots movements and advocacy groups play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and legislative priorities. However, the current political climate presents challenges, particularly given the Republican majority in the House and Senate's recent failure to advance key legislation.

Looking ahead, the effectiveness of any new regulations will depend heavily on proper implementation and enforcement mechanisms. States have demonstrated varying levels of success in local regulation, highlighting the importance of consistent legal frameworks while respecting Second Amendment rights. As data continues to show the significant public health impact of assault weapons, legislative efforts are likely to remain a critical focus in the coming years.
