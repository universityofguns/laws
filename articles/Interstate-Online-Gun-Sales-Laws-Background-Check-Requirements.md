# Interstate Online Gun Sales Laws: Understanding Background Check Requirements

The online gun market has expanded dramatically in recent years, offering unprecedented access to firearms. While the internet has facilitated legitimate transactions, it has also created significant risks by enabling prohibited individuals to obtain weapons. This article examines the legal framework governing interstate online gun sales, highlighting the federal requirements and state variations. We analyze how these laws impact public safety, drawing from comprehensive research on online firearm transactions. The constitutional validity of background check regulations is considered, including perspectives from legal scholars and court decisions.


## Federal Background Check Requirements

Federal law requires licensed gun dealers to perform background checks, including verifying purchase eligibility against federal criminal records databases, before completing a sale (Federal Law Requirements, Everytown Research). However, this regulation contains significant exceptions for unlicensed sellers and online transactions (Unlicensed Sale Loophole, Everytown Research).

The majority of gun transfers in the United States (78%) currently take place through unlicensed sellers, allowing buyers to bypass federal background check requirements entirely (Everytown Research). This unlicensed sale loophole results in approximately 22% of all firearm transactions occurring without federal regulation (Background Check Requirement, Everytown Research).

Since the implementation of the federal background check system in 1994, it has successfully prevented over 3.5 million prohibited sales. However, this success rate drops dramatically when unlicensed sellers are involved - of the 170,000 prevented sales in 2017, 39% involved convicted felons who would have obtained firearms through unlicensed sellers if not for the existing checks (Prevented Sales, Everytown Research).

The internet has exacerbated these issues by enabling unlicensed sellers to reach broader audiences. On Armslist.com, one of the largest online platforms for gun sales, over 1.2 million ads appeared annually for firearm purchases that would not legally require background checks (Internet Gun Sales, Everytown Research). Of those responding to unlicensed sellers' ads, nearly 11% would fail background checks, compared to just 2% at licensed gun stores (Internet Gun Sales, Everytown Research).

Despite these risks, federal courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of background check laws. Leading constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe testified that once the lawfulness of prohibiting gun possession by certain individuals is accepted, the constitutionality of a reasonable background check system follows automatically (Constitutional Validity, Everytown Research). Even conservative legal scholars support this position, though political challenges to these laws remain contentious (Constitutional Validity, Everytown Research).


## State Variations in Background Check Laws

The regulation of online firearm sales varies significantly across states. While Colorado, Oregon, and North Carolina require background checks for all gun purchases, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, and Tennessee have no background check requirements for unlicensed sellers, creating a significant public safety risk (An Investigation of the Online Firearm Marketplace, Everytown Research).

In states that close this loopholes and mandate background checks, the effect is evident: 84% of unlicensed sellers indicate they would require background checks, compared to just 6% in states without such laws (An Investigation of the Online Firearm Marketplace, Everytown Research). However, these voluntary measures often fall short - of those requiring checks, only 72% actually perform them, leaving room for prohibited buyers to obtain guns (An Investigation of the Online Firearm Marketplace, Everytown Research).

These state variations compound the existing federal framework. Federal law prohibits direct sales across state lines between unlicensed persons, mandating that firearms be shipped through licensed dealers. For within-state transactions, licensed dealers must conduct background checks, though unlicensed sellers remain exempt from these requirements (Interstate & Online Gun Sales, Everytown Research).

This patchwork of laws has enabled dangerous trends to persist. Of the firearms purchased online in 2019, 45% were bought without background checks, with the internet expanding access for prohibited buyers. In states without background check requirements, nearly 11% of potential online buyers would fail federal background checks - seven times the rate observed at licensed dealers or other required contexts (An Investigation of the Online Firearm Marketplace, Everytown Research).

The scale of this problem is staggering. Major online platforms like Armslist.com host an average of 1.6 million unlicensed firearm sales ads per year, with 78% coming from states not requiring background checks. From 2014 to 2018, these platforms facilitated sales involving 1 million prohibited purchasers, demonstrating the urgent need for consistent, state-level regulation on online gun transactions (An Investigation of the Online Firearm Marketplace, Everytown Research).


## Online Gun Sales Platform Operations

Major online platforms like Armslist facilitate firearm transactions between both licensed dealers and unlicensed sellers, creating significant public safety concerns. These platforms function similarly to Craigslist, allowing both FFLs (Federal Firearms Licensees) and unlicensed sellers to post firearm ads. Between 2018 and 2020, Armslist collected over 9 million posts, with 68% listing firearms for sale.

The majority of these gun-sale ads come from unlicensed sellers, posting an average of 1.6 million ads annually. These ads represent 80% of all unique firearm sales ads on the platform. Each year, unlicensed sellers post 1.2 million ads offering firearms for sale, with 78% of these ads originating from states that do not legally require background checks. The data covers handguns, rifles, and shotguns, excluding NFA (National Firearms Act) firearms, muzzle loaders, and antique firearms.

The transaction process typically involves face-to-face meetings following online sales, with completed sales often taking less than three minutes. Sellers typically conduct background checks only when legally required, indicating a significant reliance on state-level regulations to govern firearm purchases.

The online marketplace has expanded access to prohibited buyers, with federal data showing that 45% of gun owners who acquired firearms online in the past two years did so without background checks. Of those responding to unlicensed sellers' ads, nearly 11% would fail background checks, compared to just 2% at licensed dealers or other required contexts.

Research indicates that states requiring background checks on all gun sales show lower rates of firearm homicide, suicide, and trafficking compared to those requiring only handgun sales. The internet's role in facilitating these transactions has raised concerns about compliance with federal regulations, particularly regarding licensing and background check requirements.


## Background Check Effectiveness

The existing federal background check system has proven effective in preventing illegal firearm acquisitions, having blocked over 3.5 million prohibited sales since its implementation in 1994 (Everytown Research). A significant portion of these prevented sales involved convicted felons, with 39% of 170,000 blocked sales in 2017 attributed to this specific category (Everytown Research).

However, the current system's effectiveness is heavily influenced by state-level regulations. In states that have closed the unlicensed seller loophole and mandated background checks, the impact is particularly pronounced. For instance, 84% of unlicensed sellers in these states report that they would require background checks, compared to just 6% in states without similar requirements (Everytown Research). This voluntary compliance indicates the potential for reduced illegal gun acquisition when background checks are mandated.

The internet's role in facilitating firearm transactions has both amplified these trends and presented new challenges. Major online platforms like Armslist.com host an average of 1.6 million unlicensed firearm sales ads per year, with 78% of these ads originating from states that do not legally require background checks (Everytown Research). Of those responding to unlicensed sellers' ads, nearly 11% would fail federal background checks, compared to just 2% at licensed dealers or other required contexts (Everytown Research).

Research indicates that states requiring background checks on all gun sales show significantly lower rates of firearm homicide, suicide, and trafficking (Everytown Research). The effectiveness of these laws is underscored by the documented prevention of over 5 million prohibited sales since 1994 (Everytown Research). While the Constitutionality of these laws has never been successfully challenged in court, federal courts have consistently upheld their legal validity, and constitutional scholars universally support their compatibility with Second Amendment protections (Everytown Research).


## Legal Framework and Constitutional Considerations

Federal courts have consistently upheld background check laws, and constitutional scholar consensus supports their constitutionality, though challenges remain politically contentious.

Since the implementation of the federal background check system in 1994, no court has ever struck down a background check law under the Second Amendment. Leading constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe testified that once the constitutionality of prohibiting gun possession by certain individuals is accepted, the constitutionality of a reasonable background check system follows automatically. Even conservative legal scholars agree that a background checks law would not violate the Second Amendment.

The legal framework supporting these regulations stems from Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. Under the Commerce Clause, products like firearms that have traveled in interstate commerce, or activities that substantially relate to or affect interstate commerce, fall under federal regulatory authority. This has provided a constitutional foundation for requiring background checks on all gun sales involving interstate commerce.

The effectiveness of these laws has also been validated through extensive research. Studies show that states requiring background checks on all gun sales experience lower rates of firearm homicide, suicide, and trafficking compared to those with fewer restrictions. While implementation challenges exist, particularly in private sales between unlicensed individuals, universal background check programs have been shown to reduce gun-related deaths by making it more difficult for prohibited individuals to obtain firearms.
