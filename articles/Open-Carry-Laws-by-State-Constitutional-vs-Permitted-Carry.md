# Open Carry Laws by State: Constitutional vs Permitted Carry

In the evolving landscape of gun control legislation, the right to openly carry firearms has become a subject of intense political and legal debate across the United States. While the Supreme Court's landmark decisions in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) established that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms for self-defense, the practical implications of this right vary dramatically from state to state. The legal framework for open carry reflects this divide, with 45 states allowing some form of open carry while five states outright prohibit it.

This article examines the complex web of state and local regulations governing open carry, from the permitless freedoms enjoyed in states like Alaska and Idaho to the stringent restrictions imposed in California and New York. We'll examine the legal definitions that determine what constitutes open carry, the patchwork of state laws that permit or restrict it, and the role of local ordinances in shaping firearm rights. The article will also explore the constitutional basis for open carry rights, drawing from Supreme Court precedents and state constitutional provisions.


## Open Carry Definition and Jurisdictions

The legal framework for open carry across the United States varies significantly by state. While nearly every state allows some form of open carry, the specifics of what's legally permissible and where it's allowed can change dramatically from one jurisdiction to another. 

Open carry typically refers to the act of carrying a firearm in public where it is either partially or fully visible. However, the definition can differ by state—some specify that a weapon is "fully visible" while others permit "partially visible" firearms. Additionally, the term "loaded weapon" can have several interpretations: in some cases, a live round must be in the firing chamber; in others, a magazine with ammunition must be present regardless of the chamber state; and in most states where open carry is restricted, both the firearm and ammunition must be present, chamber empty or not.

The practice is divided into two main categories of states: those with permissive open carry laws and those with local restrictions. There are 45 states where open carry is either unrestricted or requires only minimal licensing. In these jurisdictions, individuals over the age of 18 or 21 (depending on the state) can openly carry firearms without a permit, either on foot or in a vehicle, with few exceptions.

However, 37 of these states fall into a second category: those with local restrictions. While they generally allow open carry without a permit, local governments can impose additional regulations, particularly regarding when and where firearms may be carried. For instance, some states permit open carry in rural areas while restricting it in urban centers.

The remaining five states—California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Washington D.C.—either prohibit open carry outright or allow it only under extremely limited conditions. In California, open carry is generally prohibited except in rural counties, though local bans can exist. Florida restricts it to specific activities like hunting and target practice. New York allows it but requires permits for jurisdictions over 200,000 population. Illinois permits it only in unincorporated rural areas, though local bans may apply.

This patchwork of regulations means that understanding open carry laws requires knowledge not just of state statutes but also local ordinances. The lack of uniformity has led some states to specifically preempt local restrictions, allowing statewide consistency in gun carry laws.


## Permissive Open Carry States

At least 18 states allow open carry for individuals who are 18 years old or older, while another 27 states permit open carry but may require a permit or have additional restrictions. Permitless open carry is allowed in these states:

- Alabama: No permit required for both open and concealed carry, though property and vehicle restrictions may apply for those without concealed handgun permits

- Alaska: Anyone 21 and older can openly or concealed carry without a permit

- Arizona: No permit required for open or concealed carry

- Arkansas: All citizens over 18 can carry concealed firearms without permit, with public view allowed

- Delaware: Permitless, local restrictions preempted; city of Dover repealed grandfathered ordinance restricting open carry in 2015

- Idaho: Permitless, open carry without permit allowed, local restrictions preempted

- Indiana: Permitless, open carry of handguns allowed without restriction

- Iowa: Citizens 21 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- Kansas: Citizens 18 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- Kentucky: Citizens 18 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- Louisiana: Citizens 18 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- Maine: Citizens 21 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- Mississippi: Citizens 18 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- Montana: Citizens 18 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- Nevada: Citizens 18 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- New Hampshire: Citizens 18 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- New Mexico: Citizens 19 and older can carry unloaded long guns with Firearm Purchaser Identification Card, but open carry of handguns requires attorney's office permit

- North Carolina: Permitted without permit, though tribal laws apply

- North Dakota: Individuals 18 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, with public view allowed

- Oklahoma: Open carry allowed without permit, vehicle restrictions, ID requirement

- Oregon: Individuals 21 and older can carry concealed weapons without permit, though loaded firearms may be restricted in some areas

- Pennsylvania: Open carry legal without permit, though vehicle restrictions, Philadelphia restrictions, and local exemptions apply

- South Carolina: Open carry legal without permit, local restrictions preempted

- South Dakota: Open carry legal for 18+ years old, with local restrictions preempted

- Wisconsin: Partial preemption allowing 21+ to carry without permit, 18+ for military

- Wyoming: Partial preemption allowing 18+ to carry without permit, 21+ for military

These states vary in their approach to local restrictions: some preempt local laws completely, while others allow limited local regulation. For example, Florida restricts open carry to specific activities like hunting and target practice, though it does not require a permit. California allows open carry in rural counties with less than 200,000 residents but generally prohibits it statewide, though local bans can still apply. This patchwork of regulations reflects the national divide over gun rights, with states largely divided between strong permitless carry laws and those with significant restrictions or outright bans.


## States with Local Restrictions

Local restrictions significantly impact open carry rights across the United States, with 46 states allowing some form of open carry while 4 states prohibit it outright. These local variations often center around municipalities implementing their own regulations.

Local governments can impose restrictions on when and where firearms may be carried, though the extent of this authority varies by state. Some states fully preempt local regulations, allowing statewide consistency in gun carry laws. However, other states permit local restrictions to varying degrees.

For example, California allows open carry in rural counties with less than 200,000 residents, but generally prohibits it statewide, with local bans still applying in some areas. Florida permits open carry primarily for hunting and target practice, though it does not require a permit statewide. Wisconsin amended its disorderly conduct statute in 2011 to allow open carry, while Oklahoma's SB 1733 allows it for concealed permit holders, though with vehicle restrictions and ID requirements.

The impact of local restrictions extends beyond just urban vs. rural areas. Businesses often maintain their own policies regarding firearms on premises, which can conflict with state laws. For instance, while open carry may be legal under state law, specific establishments like retail stores or restaurants might prohibit firearms on their property.

These local variations reflect broader regional differences in gun rights policies. While some cities maintain restrictive local regulations, rural areas often align more closely with state-level permissiveness. Understanding these local dynamics requires firearm owners to research both state statutes and local ordinances to determine their specific rights and obligations.


## Non-Permissive Open Carry States

The laws in California, Florida, Illinois, and New York represent four distinct approaches to open carry regulation. These states either prohibit the practice entirely or allow it under extremely limited circumstances. 

California stands out for its comprehensive restrictions, making it one of the most restrictive gun carry states in the nation. While it permits open carry in rural counties with less than 200,000 residents, statewide regulations generally prohibit the practice. The exception allows carrying an exposed, unloaded handgun if the carrier "reasonably believes immediate danger exists."

In Florida, open carry legislation has undergone significant changes in recent years. The state briefly legalized open carry from 2015 to 2016 before reverting to its current framework. Under current regulations, open carry is permitted primarily for hunting and target practice activities, though local governments maintain significant discretion regarding implementation.

Illinois presents a unique challenge for open carry enthusiasts. While legal in unincorporated rural areas, the practice faces significant obstacles due to Attorney General opinions that effectively prohibit it. The state's restrictions highlight the complex interplay between state and local law enforcement policies that can dramatically impact firearm rights.

New York's approach represents a middle ground between outright prohibition and permitless carry. While the state does not generally permit open carry, it recognizes that certain activities like hunting and self-defense might legally justify it. The limitations reflect broader statewide regulations rather than total prohibition.


## State Constitutional Carry Laws

The right to carry firearms under open carry laws is deeply rooted in constitutional protections, particularly as established by the U.S. Supreme Court cases District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010). These landmark decisions have significantly shaped state gun laws regarding both open and concealed carry.

At the federal level, the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the right to keep and bear arms, though the Supreme Court has made clear that this right is not unlimited. In its 2008 decision, Heller established that self-defense is a central component of the Second Amendment and invalidated D.C.'s handgun ban, setting a precedent for state-level gun control laws.

State constitutions further influence open carry regulations. Forty-four states contain Second Amendment-like provisions protecting the right to keep and bear arms, with none explicitly prohibiting open carry. Kentucky's state constitution even empowers the state to prohibit concealed carry while specifically protecting open carry through court decision Holland v. Kentucky (1956), which states: "A person is granted the right to carry a weapon openly, with no one may question the wearer's right so to do."

However, state laws can vary significantly in their implementation of open carry rights. As of March 7, 2024, 15 U.S. jurisdictions have constitutional carry laws, while others maintain permit requirements for open carry. Wisconsin's 2011 amendment to its disorderly conduct statute and Oklahoma's SB 1733 (2012) exemplify states' approaches to open carry for concealed permit holders.

The legal framework for open carry also varies based on local restrictions. While 45 states allow some form of open carry, local governments can implement specific regulations regarding when and where firearms may be carried. This can range from complete bans in urban centers to rural county exemptions, as seen in California's rural county provisions or Washington State's de facto Castle Doctrine/Stand Your Ground law.

Businesses maintain considerable discretion regarding firearms on premises, with many continuing to prohibit firearms on their property despite state-level permissiveness. Understanding these local dynamics requires firearm owners to research both state statutes and local ordinances to determine their specific rights and obligations.
