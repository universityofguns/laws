# BB Gun & Air Gun Laws: Non-Powder Firearm Regulations by State

The proliferation of non-powder firearms has created complex legal challenges for both gun owners and law enforcement agencies across the United States. While federal regulations provide some guidance, the treatment of these weapons varies dramatically from state to state, with some jurisdictions classifying them as traditional firearms and others imposing specific age restrictions and school grounds regulations. These legal differences have significant implications for gun ownership, particularly for items like airsoft guns, which share toys' appearance but can discharge projectiles at velocities exceeding 300 feet per second. Understanding the legal landscape surrounding non-powder firearms is crucial for responsible gun owners, while law enforcement agencies face the challenge of distinguishing between real weapons and non-powder firearms in the field.


## Federal Regulations

Federal law requires that all imitation firearms, except traditional BB or pellet-firing air guns, be equipped with permanently affixed blaze orange barrel tips. The Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that BB guns and pellet rifles cause at least four deaths per year, highlighting the inherent danger of these devices. While federal law prevents states from outright prohibiting the sale of traditional BB or pellet guns, it allows states to regulate sales to minors without conflicting with federal law.

The regulations surrounding these weapons vary significantly across states. For instance, New Jersey and Rhode Island classify all non-powder guns as firearms, while other states have specific age restrictions or school grounds regulations. The legal interpretation of airsoft guns further demonstrates this variability, with some states treating them as firearms requiring licenses and others allowing their use under certain conditions.


## State-Specific Regulations

The treatment of non-powder firearms varies significantly across states, with some implementing stricter regulations than federal law requires. For example, New Jersey and Rhode Island classify all non-powder guns as firearms, requiring specific storage and display requirements. Barrel parts must also be purchased from licensed gun repair shops in West Virginia, raising the barrier to ownership.

Age restrictions on possession, use, or transfer of non-powder guns range from 16 to 18 years old across different states. However, federal law generally requires buyers to be 18, with some exceptions allowing younger children to use these weapons under adult supervision.

The proliferation of airsoft guns has led many states to implement specific regulations. In Michigan, these weapons are classified as firearms requiring a license, while Delaware prohibits their use by minors without parental permission. Some cities have taken additional measures, such as New York City's requirement that all air pistol and air rifle possessors obtain a valid firearm identification card.

The impact of these regulations has been demonstrated through various incidents. In South Carolina, the proliferation of non-powder firearms led to the prohibition of handguns at state parks and facilities, while Michigan's classification of airsoft guns as firearms requiring licenses has created additional compliance burdens for owners. These regulations reflect the challenging balance between public safety and individual rights that continues to shape state gun laws.


## Age Restrictions and Purchasing Requirements

In most states, buyers must be 18 years old to purchase BB guns, airguns, air rifles, or pellet guns, though some allow younger children to use these weapons under adult supervision. Federal law requires imitation firearms (except traditional BB or pellet-firing air guns) to have blaze orange barrel tips.

The legal framework governing these weapons varies significantly across states. For example, New Jersey and Rhode Island classify all non-powder guns as firearms, requiring specific storage and display requirements. West Virginia mandates that barrel parts must be purchased from licensed gun repair shops. Age restrictions range from 16 to 18 years old across different states, with some exceptions allowing younger children to use these weapons under adult supervision.

Local regulations often provide additional restrictions. New York City, for instance, requires air pistol and air rifle possessors to obtain a valid firearm identification card. This demonstrates the significant variation in regulation across jurisdictions, with specific requirements often influenced by local conditions and priorities.


## Urban and School Regulations

Numerous cities have established their own regulations beyond state laws. For instance, New York City requires all air pistol and air rifle possessors to obtain a valid firearm identification card, while prohibiting airsoft gun use in public places. Minneapolis mandates that airsoft guns be unloaded and encased when carried and requires them to have orange tips or be brightly colored. Denver requires that all air guns, defined as any instrument expelling a projectile up to 6 millimeters in caliber, be orange-tipped and openly visible.

School grounds regulations vary significantly. In California, all air guns are prohibited on school grounds, while Colorado mandates mandatory expulsion for students bringing airsoft guns to school. Illinois has implemented age restrictions, requiring .18 caliber or higher ammunition with 700 FPS or more for air guns after July 13, 2012. Meanwhile, Maryland's regulations explicitly prohibit air rifle and BB gun possession in public places, allowing only adult ownership.

Local ordinances further refine these regulations. The City of King in North Carolina prohibits firing BB guns, pellet guns, or air rifles within city limits, demonstrating how municipal regulations can create additional compliance burdens for gun owners. These localized restrictions highlight the complex patchwork of regulations governing non-powder firearms across the United States.


## Incident Response and Law Enforcement

Law enforcement agencies frequently face challenges when attempting to distinguish between non-powder firearms and real weapons, as demonstrated by the tragic case of John Crawford in Ohio. In this incident, Crawford was fatally shot by Beavercreek Police officers after allegedly refusing to comply with their commands while holding a Crosman MK-177 rifle, which he had purchased at Walmart. His wife reported that Crawford was unarmed when shot, holding a "toy gun" he had picked up at the store.

Federal law requires imitation firearms, with the exception of traditional BB or pellet-firing air guns, to have permanently affixed blaze orange barrel tips. These requirements may supersede inconsistent state or local markings. While federal law prevents states from outright prohibiting the sale of traditional BB or pellet guns, it allows states to impose other regulations on their sale to minors as long as these regulations do not completely ban sales.

Airsoft guns, despite their toy-like appearance, present significant safety concerns due to their potential to cause severe injury. These weapons use air pressure to fire plastic projectiles and pose particular risks when discharged at unprotected eyes. Proper protection requires masks or full-seal goggles, as even low-velocity BB guns can cause serious harm. Some airsoft guns feature powerful springs capable of breaking skin at close range, highlighting the need for specific engagement distances and FPS (Feet Per Second) limitations for DMRs and sniper rifles.

State laws vary dramatically in their treatment of airsoft guns. While Arkansas has explicitly banned their possession, California has implemented Senate Bill No. 199, which prohibits furnishing airsoft guns. Transporting these devices requires secure packaging, and public carrying usually demands consent from the target property owner. Federal law mandates a 6 mm wide blaze orange tip for all airsoft guns, though the legality of removing this marking varies by state.

Proper identification and regulation of non-powder firearms are crucial to prevent deadly incidents. New York City demonstrates effective practices through its requirement that all air pistol and air rifle possessors obtain a valid firearm identification card. This approach helps law enforcement distinguish between real weapons and non-powder firearms while maintaining public safety.
