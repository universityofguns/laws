# Gun Dealer License Requirements: Federal and New York State Regulations

Regulating the firearms industry is crucial for public safety and responsible gun ownership. Federal and state governments have established comprehensive licensing requirements to ensure that only qualified individuals and businesses can operate firearm dealerships. This article examines the extensive regulations governing firearm dealers, including federal licensing standards and New York State's stringent requirements. Understanding these regulations is essential for anyone considering a career in the firearms industry or for citizens who need to comply with legal obligations related to firearms ownership.


## Federal Gun Dealer Requirements

All gun dealers must obtain a Federal Firearm License (FFL), which was established under the Gun Control Act of 1968 to implement stricter regulations than the 1938 Federal Firearms Act. This license enables individuals or companies to conduct businesses involving firearms and ammunition.

To obtain an FFL, applicants must be at least 21 years old, U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, and legally permitted to possess firearms and ammunition. The business must have a proper physical location that meets local zoning requirements for conducting FFL activities. Home-based FFL operations are permitted under federal law, though specific regulations vary by state.

The application process requires the business to be properly registered with the state and have an employer identification number (EIN) if not operating as a sole proprietor. The business must demonstrate intent to operate as a firearm dealer through occasional sales or transfer activities, distinguishing itself from personal collections.

Federal law prohibits false statements on FFL applications, and all licensees are subject to compliance with 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(5) penalties for non-compliance. The license must be displayed clearly at gun shows, and dealers are required to maintain strict record-keeping and reporting, including Brady Law requirements for firearm acquisitions and dispositions.

The FFL system includes various types of licenses based on specific firearm business activities, with different requirements for ammunition manufacture, import/export, and curio & relic firearm dealing. Non-citizen applicants must meet additional eligibility criteria, including being lawful permanent residents or meeting specific exceptions for temporary visitors and government officials.


## New York State License Specifications

All license holders must maintain detailed records for each handgun, including acquisition dates, source entities, and disposition information. These records must be available for inspection by the Pistol Licensing Bureau, police officers, or peace officers.

To transfer firearms, license holders must submit written notifications to either the State Police or appropriate licensing officers in New York City, Nassau, or Suffolk counties. Licenses are subject to regular inspection by the Suffolk County Police Department and Treasury Department to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

The licensing process involves multiple layers of approval, with specific requirements for different types of firearm transactions. Licensed dealers may dispose of handguns to New York State residents with valid pistol licenses, long guns to residents of any state, or to other firearm dealers with appropriate licenses. The transfer of handguns between licensed dealers requires both federal and state licenses to be properly aligned.

Non-licensed dealers must maintain federal firearm record-keeping requirements, including documentation of firearm acquisitions and dispositions. These records must be maintained in bound books that detail each firearm's serial number, make, model, caliber, and acquisition/disposition dates. The records must be available for inspection at the licensed premises and must be surrendered to the Pistol Licensing Bureau upon license cancellation, suspension, or revocation.


## Application Requirements and Eligibility

Federal law mandates that all firearm dealers be at least 21 years old, U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, and legally permitted to possess firearms and ammunition. Non-citizens seeking an FFL must demonstrate lawful presence through either green card status or specific nonimmigrant visa categories, including temporary workers, students maintaining foreign residence, and certain government officials.

The application process requires applicants to have a valid employer identification number (EIN) and demonstrate intent to operate a business through occasional sales or transfer activities. While basic eligibility criteria include passing background checks, the specific requirements for each applicant vary significantly based on their immigration status. Lawful permanent residents, for example, may face additional scrutiny, while those in nonimmigrant visa categories generally meet the eligibility requirements.

State-level requirements add substantial complexity to the licensing process. New York, for instance, maintains the most restrictive requirements in the country, demanding applicants navigate multiple layers of state and local regulations. This includes registering as a business, obtaining local zoning approval, and completing extensive paperwork for both federal and state licenses. The process also requires compliance with specific business intent requirements, meaning occasional sales or transfer activities must be documented to demonstrate proper operation as a firearm dealer.


## Record Keeping and Reporting Requirements

Licensees must maintain strict record-keeping and reporting requirements, with specific details outlined in various ATF regulations. Manufacturing records must be retained for 20 years and include detailed information on firearm acquisition and disposition, including serial numbers, manufacturers, and date of transaction. Importers are required to file acquisition records within 15 days of importation and disposition records within 7 days of the transaction.

All firearms acquired must be documented with information from the firearm's frame, receiver, barrel, or slide, including type, caliber/gauge, and manufacturer. Disposition records must be retained for 20 years when firearms are transferred to non-licensees, while other records must be maintained permanently. The records must be available for inspection at the licensed premises and must be computerized according to ATF Ruling 2016-1 requirements.

New York State requirements mandate detailed record-keeping for both gun dealers and gunsmiths. Handgun dealers must maintain two copies of purchase documents, one with the County seal and one for the Pistol Licensing Bureau, while gunsmiths must maintain bound record books with specific columns for serial numbers, make, model, caliber, and nature of repair or alteration. These records must be available for inspection by authorized personnel and must be surrendered to the Bureau upon license cancellation, suspension, or revocation. Licensing authorities conduct regular inspections to ensure compliance with these stringent record-keeping requirements.


## Security and Location Requirements

Building security requirements are strictly enforced, with firearms kept in locked fireproof safes or vaults outside business hours. Ammunition storage must be separate from firearms, with video surveillance required at all entry points and sales areas. The security alarm system must be monitored by a licensed security company with 24/7 central station monitoring, including complete protection of all entry/exit points.

Firearms dealers must employ trained personnel who complete initial training within 30 days of hire and annual training thereafter. All employees must verify customer eligibility before firearm transactions, excluding minors unless supervised by a parent or guardian. The dealer must display warning notices prominently at the entrance and additional sales areas, using at least 26-point type on an 8.5" x 11" sign.

Zoning regulations require proper commercial classification for firearms dealers, with restrictions for home-based operations. The business must maintain a valid state business license and obtain local business permits. The premises must comply with fire and building codes, with multi-tenant buildings requiring licensee presence during non-business hours. Specific requirements vary by local jurisdiction, with some areas having more restrictive regulations than others.
