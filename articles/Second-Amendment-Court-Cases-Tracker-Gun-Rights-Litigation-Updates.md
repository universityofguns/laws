# Second Amendment Court Cases Tracker

The Supreme Court's 2022 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen marked a pivotal moment in Second Amendment jurisprudence, spawning over 1,600 federal court cases that have reshaped how gun regulations are evaluated. As states across the country respond to this evolving legal landscape, a complex web of litigation is emerging, challenging everything from young adult firearm restrictions to federal business alcohol sale bans. This comprehensive overview examines the key Second Amendment cases reshaping American gun law, from the national stage to local jurisdictions, highlighting how historical precedent is being wielded to shape the future of firearms policy.


## Key Gun Rights Litigation Cases

The federal judiciary has become increasingly active in Second Amendment litigation since the Supreme Court's landmark decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen (2022). More than 1,600 federal court decisions have cited Bruen as of September 2024, demonstrating the case's significant impact on Second Amendment jurisprudence.

One notable example is the National Shooting Sports Foundation's lawsuit against the State of New York (National Shooting Sports Foundation v. Brown), which was filed in the Fourth Circuit. The case involves challenges to New York's firearm regulations and remains pending. Similarly, in Colorado, the Langston v. Humphreys case was filed in the Colorado courts and remains active.

Several other significant cases have emerged across the country:

- In California, a series of cases including Gallagher v. DM, RM v. CM, and JK v. JH have been pending in New York state appellate courts. These cases challenge various gun restrictions and regulations.

- In Illinois, the National Shooting Sports Foundation has filed a lawsuit against the State of Illinois (National Shooting Sports Foundation v. Raoul), which is pending in federal court.

- In Texas, multiple cases have been filed under the Firearms Policy Coalition's legal tracker, including challenges to gun regulations in various jurisdictions.

- In Massachusetts, several key cases have been active, including Granata v. Campbell and Capen v. Campbell, both challenging Massachusetts' firearm restrictions. These cases are working through the legal system under the framework established by Bruen and further clarified by United States v. Rahimi.

These cases represent a diverse landscape of Second Amendment litigation, with challenges to firearm restrictions appearing in multiple states and federal circuits. The legal landscape continues to evolve as courts apply and interpret the Supreme Court's historical inquiry standard established in Bruen.


## Second Amendment Jurisprudence Developments

Following the landmark decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen (2022), the Supreme Court has taken a more nuanced approach to evaluating firearm regulations through its historical inquiry framework. This approach requires governments to demonstrate that modern restrictions align with historical firearm regulations, considering both "how" burdensome the regulation is on armed self-defense and "why" it justifies that burden (1st v. 2nd brief).

A significant development in this area is the Court's decision in United States v. Rahimi (2024), which clarified several aspects of Bruen's historical inquiry. The Court upheld a federal law banning firearm possession by domestic violence restraining order subjects, rejecting the need for a "historical twin" in favor of a more flexible "historical analogue" approach (Gould v. Morgan brief). This decision represents a moderation of the Court's most extreme historical standards, as Justice Thomas previously noted that the Court's earlier decisions have provided "minimal guidance" and left "essential questions" unanswered (U.S. v. Rahimi brief).

The Court's jurisprudence continues to evolve in other key areas. In McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), the Supreme Court established that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment as to the states, expanding its application beyond the federal government. The Court has also developed a two-step framework through opinions like Worman v. Healey (2019), where it upheld Massachusetts' public carry licensing regime and assault weapons ban.

The dual nature of the Second Amendment, as recognized by scholars at Duke Law School, emphasizes the right's primary justification in public safety rather than individual autonomy or preventing tyranny (Duke Center for Firearms Law brief). This perspective aligns with founding-era natural rights concepts that prioritized creating a representative government serving the public good.

The legal landscape remains complex, with ongoing debates about the appropriate level of scrutiny for different types of gun restrictions and the implications of sensitive place doctrine. These developments continue to shape Second Amendment jurisprudence in the United States.


## Gun Rights Litigation Landscape

The legal landscape continues to expand with new challenges to firearm regulations across the country. Important cases recently emerged in states including Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, and Georgia. In Illinois, Worth v. Jacobson challenges the state's law restricting firearms ownership for young adults. Minnesota's Azzopardi v. Rosenblum and Oregon's Baughcum v. Jackson also represent significant legal developments.

The legal landscape has become increasingly complex, with plaintiffs challenging regulations in diverse contexts. The recent case of Richards v. Bonta highlights this trend, as it challenges California's 10-day waiting period for firearm purchases. In another development, Rocky Mountain Gun Owners v. Polis successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Colorado's minimum age law before the Tenth Circuit ultimately upheld the restriction as presumptively lawful.

The case landscape includes critical challenges to sensitive place regulations. Koons v. Platkin in New Jersey successfully obtained an injunction from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, demonstrating the ongoing debate over these restrictive laws. Meanwhile, Williams v. McFadden addresses North Carolina's requirement for mental health records checks for concealed carry permit applications, showing the broad range of Second Amendment litigation now before the courts.

These developments continue to shape the legal framework surrounding gun rights, with plaintiffs challenging regulations in multiple states and federal circuits. As the legal landscape evolves, courts will increasingly need to balance Second Amendment rights with public safety concerns in varying legal contexts.


## Firearms Policy Coalition's Legal Tracker

As of January 2025, the Firearms Policy Coalition's legal tracker monitors numerous Second Amendment cases across federal courts. Notable cases in Texas include Elite Precision Customs v. ATF, challenging the federal ban on interstate handgun transfers. In Pennsylvania, Lara v. Paris contests the state's ban on young adult gun rights, while Massachusetts's Granata v. Campbell challenges the state's Approved Firearms Roster and Attorney General's handgun sales regulations.

The tracker highlights recent developments in regulatory challenges, including FOAC v. Pittsburgh gun control ordinances and Heeter v. James on New York's body armor ban. Additionally, several challenges focus on specific firearm types and locations - Struck v. Platkin on New Jersey's "1-in-30" purchase ban, Wehr-Darroca v. DC on large capacity magazine restrictions, and Elite Precision Customs v. ATF on federal handgun transfer regulations.

Public carry bans face significant scrutiny, with cases like Christian v. James challenging New York's restrictions and Koons v. Platkin contesting New Jersey's bans. The tracker also monitors federal gun laws, including FPC v. Garland on firearm prohibitions at post offices and Ziegenfuss v. Martin on Texas's business alcohol sale bans.

The legal landscape demonstrates ongoing challenges to both state and federal firearm regulations. Recent legal developments include Michigan's ban on polling location firearms and Southern Illinois's assault weapons ban decision. Courts continue to address youth firearm ownership restrictions, felony convictions, public housing regulations, and specific firearm type bans. The evolving jurisprudence balances Second Amendment rights with public safety concerns through complex regulatory analysis.


## Second Amendment Scholarship

The evolving legal landscape of the Second Amendment has generated significant scholarly analysis, particularly at Duke Law School. Professor Joseph Blocher, co-director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law, has emerged as a leading scholar in this field. Under his guidance, the center has produced comprehensive studies on Second Amendment jurisprudence, combining historical analysis with contemporary legal interpretation.

Scholarship in this area has focused on several key aspects. Professor Blocher's work highlights the importance of contextualizing Second Amendment rights within historical legal frameworks, particularly as they evolved from English common law through American constitutional development. This research emphasizes that while contemporary legal standards shape constitutional interpretation, historical practices provide essential guidance for understanding the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.

The center's scholarship has also addressed the practical implications of Second Amendment litigation. This includes detailed analyses of specific court decisions, such as New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, which established a new historical inquiry framework for evaluating firearm regulations. The research examines how courts apply this framework, considering both the severity of the regulation's impact on armed self-defense ("how") and its justifications ("why"). This nuanced approach seeks to balance individual rights with public safety concerns, particularly in light of evolving societal conditions and technological developments in firearm technology.

Emerging trends in Second Amendment scholarship also address the legal protections afforded to specific groups, such as individuals with mental health conditions or prior felony convictions. These studies analyze how courts interpret the right to bear arms in light of public safety concerns, examining the constitutional limits on government restrictions in these contexts.

The academic work continues to influence legal practice through detailed briefs and policy recommendations. This interdisciplinary approach, combining historical analysis with legal theory, represents the cutting edge of Second Amendment scholarship in the United States.
