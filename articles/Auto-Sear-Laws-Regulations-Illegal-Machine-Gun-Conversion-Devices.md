# Machine Gun Conversion Devices: Legal Landscape and Regulatory Response

In recent years, a growing concern has emerged regarding an increasingly accessible technology that can transform semiautomatic firearms into rapid-fire weapons. These so-called "machine gun conversion devices" allow a single trigger pull to discharge up to 20 rounds per second, matching military-grade automatic weapon capabilities. The devices, which can be purchased for as little as $20 or manufactured using 3D printing technology, represent a significant proliferation of fully automatic firearm capability in civilian hands. This article examines the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding machine gun conversion devices, including their technical operation, the legal authorities governing their use, state-level legislative responses, and the evolving law enforcement and public safety implications of their widespread availability.


## Introduction to Machine Gun Conversion Devices

These devices, often referred to as "Glock switches" or auto sears, enable semiautomatic firearms to fire fully automatically by modifying the trigger mechanism. A single pull of the trigger can release up to 20 rounds per second, matching or exceeding military machinegun capabilities. When inserted into a firearm, they prevent the trigger bar from re-engaging after each shot, allowing continuous fire as long as the trigger is depressed and the gun has ammunition.

The devices can be manufactured from plastic or metal and are typically small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. They can be purchased online for as little as $20 or made using 3D printing technology, which has facilitated their proliferation. Between 2012 and 2016, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recovered 814 machine gun conversion parts, which increased dramatically to 5,454 from 2017 to 2021 - a 570% increase over the previous five years.

The high rate of recovery is reflected in numerous incidents across the country. A 2019 shooting in Houston saw a single suspect use a firearm modified with an auto sear to fire 30 rounds at police officers in under three seconds, resulting in one officer's death and another's injury. Similarly, a 2023 incident in Alabama saw 89 gunshots fired during a birthday party, killing four and injuring dozens - multiple reports cited the use of weapons modified with auto sears. In another 2023 incident, an 11-year-old boy was killed when 22 shots were fired from a passing car in "the blink of an eye" - something possible, law enforcement officials stated, due to the weapon being modified to fire like a machine gun.


## Legal Status Under Federal Law

According to federal law, machine gun conversion devices fall under the definition of "machinegun" as established by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and subsequent legislation. These devices are classified as any parts designed or intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun.


### Legal Penalties and Definitions

Under federal law, the manufacture, sale, possession, transport, purchase, use, attempted manufacture, and attempted sale of machinegun conversion devices carry severe penalties. These devices are subject to the same regulatory framework as machineguns, which includes:

- Prohibition on manufacture and sale

- Restrictions on possession, transport, and purchase

- Requirements for registration and tax payment

- Penalties for violations, including fines and imprisonment


### State Regulatory Responses

As of 2023, the legal landscape varies significantly across states. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have outright bans on possession of these devices. Seven states (Alabama, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Louisiana, Wisconsin) and the District of Columbia match the federal definition in their legislation. Five states (Illinois, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Connecticut) have broader definitions that include parts designed or intended for conversion, even if not solely intended. Eleven states (Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New York, Virginia, Washington, Colorado, Iowa) have separate prohibitions without including conversion parts in their machinegun definition.


### Legislative Developments

Recent legislative activity has focused on harmonizing state definitions with federal law and implementing stricter controls. For example, New York State legislation (S9225) would define pistol converters and convertible pistols, matching federal definitions, and align criminal penalties accordingly. The bill also introduces new regulations for manufacturers, requiring them to take reasonable controls to prevent conversion device installation and use.


### Enforcement and Public Safety

Federal law enforcement reports indicate that these devices are increasingly prevalent, with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recovering significant quantities between 2012 and 2024. Recent state-level legislation reflects growing concern about these devices, with multiple states passing laws to prohibit their possession, manufacture, and sale. These regulations aim to address the public safety implications of devices that can transform semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons.


## State-Level Regulatory Responses

As of 2025, at least 26 states have enacted legislation outlawing gun conversion devices, including auto sears. These legislative efforts reflect a bipartisan consensus on the need to address devices that convert semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of firing up to 1,200 rounds per minute.


### Specific State Legislation

Alabama became the 26th state to prohibit gun conversion devices when Governor Kay Ivey signed a bill into law in 2023. The legislation makes it a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison to possess or sell parts intended to create an auto sear. Similarly, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an auto sear ban into law in February 2025 as part of a broader public safety package. New Jersey followed suit in late March 2025, with the General Assembly approving legislation that targets these devices.


### Regulatory Requirements

New York's response to these devices came through Senate Bill 2023-S7365, which amends the Penal Law and General Business Law to address pistol converters and rapid-fire modification devices. The bill defines a "pistol converter" as any device that interferes with the trigger mechanism, enabling rapid or automatic fire with a single trigger pull. Under the legislation, firearm sellers are required to implement reasonable controls to prevent the installation and use of these devices, including screening and security measures to prevent theft and straw purchases.


### Current Legal Framework

The regulatory landscape remains complex, with various legal challenges and compliance issues. New York State's approach, for example, has faced significant criticism from constitutional scholars and gun rights advocates, who argue that current federal laws already address conversion devices. Critics contend that banning an entire class of pistols (Glocks) is unnecessary and potentially unconstitutional, while supporters maintain that state-level regulations offer practical solutions to the public safety concerns posed by these devices.


## Law Enforcement and Public Safety Implications

The proliferation of these devices has led to significant legal challenges and regulatory responses at both the federal and state levels. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has documented a dramatic increase in recoveries, from 814 parts between 2012 and 2016 to 5,454 parts between 2017 and 2021 - a 570% increase.

This upward trend has not gone unnoticed by law enforcement agencies across the country. In January 2025, the ATF reported 12,360 suspected machine gun conversion devices had been recovered in the U.S. during a 34-month period ending in October 2024. These devices have been found in every state and U.S. territory, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

The legal landscape continues to evolve, with significant legislative developments at the state level. As of 2025, at least 26 states have enacted legislation outlawing gun conversion devices, including auto sears. This trend reflects a bipartisan consensus on the need to address devices that convert semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of firing up to 1,200 rounds per minute.

Federal authorities have responded through various initiatives. The Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs' Bureau of Justice Assistance and ATF have developed comprehensive training modules for law enforcement officers to detect these devices. The training, which is available through the National Public Safety Partnership Virtual Academy, supports the Department's comprehensive strategy to reduce gun violence.

The legal challenges extend beyond the United States as well. The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, established by former President Joe Biden in 2023, has developed a national strategy to address these devices. However, the office's website has since returned a 404 error, while the Trump administration has directed the Justice Department to review all federal rules and guidance for potential infringements on Second Amendment rights.


## Federal and State Regulatory Actions

Both federal and state governments have taken steps to address illegal machine gun conversion devices, including legislative actions, regulatory changes, and increased enforcement efforts. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) reported taking 814 machine gun conversion parts into custody from 2012-2016, which increased dramatically to 5,454 parts between 2017 and 2021 - a 570% increase. In January 2025, the ATF reported 12,360 suspected machine gun conversion devices had been recovered in the U.S. during a 34-month period ending in October 2024.

Following this trend, several states have enacted bans. Alabama became the 26th state to prohibit gun conversion devices when Governor Kay Ivey signed a bill into law in 2023, making possession of parts designed to convert pistols into machine guns a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Similarly, New Mexico's Democratic governor signed a law making possession of a weapon conversion device a felony punishable by up to three years in prison. New Jersey followed suit in late March 2025, with the General Assembly approving legislation targeting these devices.

The federal response has included comprehensive training modules for law enforcement officers to detect these devices through the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs' Bureau of Justice Assistance and ATF. However, the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, established by former President Joe Biden in 2023, has since disappeared from the web, returning a 404 error. Just days before President Donald Trump's inauguration, the office delivered a list of strategies aimed at cracking down on machine gun conversion devices.

Gun control advocates support state laws as an alternative to federal prosecution, particularly through legislation making it illegal to sell pistols that could be transformed into machine guns. This puts pressure on manufacturers who make money from guns that can be converted, though some, like Glock Inc., argue that people should have a Second Amendment right to own machine guns and that state laws are "duplicative" and "pure virtue signaling." The devices' practical applications, including hog elimination, further complicate the legal landscape.
