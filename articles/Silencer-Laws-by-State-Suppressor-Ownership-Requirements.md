# Suppressor Laws by State: Understanding Legal Requirements and Ownership Restrictions

The legal landscape surrounding suppressor ownership in the United States is complex, spanning federal regulations and varying state laws. While 42 states permit civilian possession, the process entails a $200 federal tax stamp and rigorous background checks. This article examines the legal requirements for suppressor ownership, including federal tax regulations, state-specific restrictions, and current legislative developments aimed at modernizing the existing framework. Understanding these regulations is crucial for individuals navigating the process of obtaining, owning, and using suppressors legally.


## Federal Regulations and Tax Stamping

The National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934 established comprehensive federal regulations for suppressor ownership, requiring a $200 tax stamp and official ATF Form 4 application through an FFL dealer or manufacturer. The process mandates personal documentation including fingerprints and a passport-style photograph, with applications submitted via certified mail to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

The tax stamp mechanism, unchanged since the 1930s, initially priced at $200 (worth $4,465 in 2023) demonstrates how the regulatory structure hasn't kept pace with current market conditions. Processing times vary significantly, from two days to nine months depending on ATF workload, with electronic submissions typically processed faster than postal submissions.

To clarify common misconceptions, suppressors do not require additional licensing beyond the federal requirements. While 42 states permit civilian ownership, specific state regulations impact the purchasing and possession process. Legal owners must remain compliant with federal standards while navigating diverse state-level restrictions and requirements.


## State-Specific Restrictions: The Legal Landscape

The restrictions on suppressor ownership vary significantly between the 42 states that allow civilian possession and the eight that completely prohibit it. These restrictions affect both purchase and use, with some states allowing general ownership while others regulate usage for specific scenarios.


### State Bans and Restrictions

Eight states - California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island - completely prohibit both the purchase and use of silencers. This includes traveling with suppressors into these states, which can result in significant legal penalties. For example, Illinois offenders face fines and up to five years in prison, while California imposes fines and up to three years in state prison.


### Hunting Regulations

While 42 states permit civilian ownership, hunting regulations vary. Connecticut stands out as the only state allowing suppressor ownership while prohibiting hunting with them. Vermont has eased its restrictions, no longer requiring special permits for hunting with suppressors.


### Legal Considerations

To legally own a suppressor, individuals must meet several criteria established by federal law: being at least 21 years old, a United States citizen, passing a background check, and meeting state residency requirements. These requirements apply regardless of whether the state generally allows suppressor possession.


### Current Legislative Environment

The federal framework for suppressor regulation has remained largely unchanged since the 1930s, with the primary requirement being a $200 tax stamp per device. Recent legislative developments include Congressional bills aimed at modernizing suppressor regulations and addressing long approval times for purchases, though these have yet to be enacted.


## Ownership Requirements: Age, Citizenship, and Background Checks

The legal framework for suppressor ownership is established under federal law, requiring individuals to meet specific criteria. To legally purchase a suppressor, you must be at least 21 years old to buy from a dealer, though some states allow 18-year-olds to purchase from individuals using Form 4 transfer, contingent on local regulations. Citizenship requirements mandate residency in the United States, and all buyers must be legally eligible to purchase firearms, with no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions, history of unlawful substance use, or dishonorable military discharge.

The purchase process requires completing an ATF Form 4 application, submitting two passport-style photos, and undergoing fingerprinting as part of the FBI Form FB-258 process. The $200 transfer tax must be paid for each suppressor purchased, and the entire application process typically involves multiple months of waiting time for approval. While federal law does not limit the number of suppressors an individual can own, state residency requirements must be met, with 42 states currently allowing civilian possession and use.

The legal status varies by state, with eight states - California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Delaware - outrightly prohibiting the purchase, transfer, and ownership of suppressors. Vermont remains unique in allowing suppressor ownership while restricting their use in hunting scenarios. The background check process uses the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and includes verification through local Chief Law Enforcement Officers (CLEOs) to ensure compliance with federal regulations.


## Hunting Regulations and Usage Restrictions

While 42 states permit civilian ownership and use, specific hunting regulations vary between states:

- Connecticut allows suppressor ownership but prohibits hunting with them

- Vermont no longer requires special permits for hunting with suppressors

- Most other states allow unrestricted hunting with suppressors, following federal law

The legal landscape varies significantly, with 42 states permitting suppressor use for hunting while eight states outrightly prohibit both purchase and use. This diversity influences both acquisition and usage processes for legally permitted states.


## The Future of Silencer Legislation

Congressional bills are currently working to modernize suppressor regulations and address the lengthy approval times for purchases. One notable legislative effort is the Tax Stamp Revenue Transfer for Wildlife and Recreation Act, introduced in November 2023. This bipartisan bill aims to reduce the suppressor waiting period to 90 days and allocate $200 million annually from suppressor stamps to wildlife management, habitat, and shooting range infrastructure.

Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) and Congressman Michael Cloud (TX-27) introduced the SHUSH Act (Silencer Hearing Solutions and Safety) to further deregulate suppressors. This legislation would eliminate federal regulation of suppressors as firearms under the National Firearms Act (NFA) and the Gun Control Act (GCA), eliminate existing taxes, fees, and registration requirements, and preempt state regulations on the manufacture, transfer, transport, or possession of suppressors. The bill also proposes striking mandatory minimum sentences for suppressor possession in certain cases and exempting suppressors from Consumer Product Safety Commission regulation.

The regulatory framework for suppressors remains under scrutiny, with advocates noting several areas for modernization. While legally classified as NFA items, suppressors are treated as restricted firearms requiring completion of Federal Form 4473. Changes to this form were implemented in April 2023 due to new statutory requirements from the Biden Administration's NICS Denial Notification Act and Bipartisan Safer Community Act, as well as ATF Final Rule 2021R-05F. These changes affect the transfer process, with any inaccuracies potentially delaying or restricting shipping.

Legislative supporters emphasize that suppressors are essential tools for hearing protection and safety, arguing they should be treated like magazines, scopes, or gun stocks rather than firearms. As of 2025, 42 states allow suppressor ownership, though specific regulations vary significantly. Eight states - California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Delaware - prohibit both purchase and use, while the District of Columbia bans ownership entirely. The legal landscape continues to evolve, with ongoing efforts to strike a balance between regulatory control and responsible civilian ownership.
