### Summary of Michigan Gun Laws

Michigan operates as a shall-issue state, with licenses distributed at the local level by county clerks. To purchase a handgun, residents need a Michigan license or a background check. Non-residents are allowed to buy long guns but not handguns. While there is no firearm registry, all handgun sales require a pistol sales record form to be filed with the Michigan State Police.

### Open Carry in Michigan

Open carry is legal for Michigan residents who are at least 18 years old and can legally possess a firearm, provided the gun is registered in their name. Non-residents must possess a valid concealed carry license from their home state to open or conceal carry in Michigan. Open carry is permitted in more locations than concealed carry, as the restrictions listed in Mich. Comp. Laws ¬ß 28.425o apply only to concealed carry.

### Concealed Carry in Michigan

Concealed carry is legal for Michigan residents with a Michigan Concealed Pistol License (CPL) and for non-residents who are at least 21 years old and have licenses or permits from their home state. CPLs are issued exclusively to residents, with exceptions for active duty military personnel stationed in Michigan or whose home of record is Michigan. Michigan Complied Laws Section 28.432a lists individuals exempt from requiring a CPL, including certain peace officers and military members in the line of duty. Obtaining a CPL necessitates completing a state-approved firearms training course with a minimum of eight hours of instruction, including three hours of range time. Certain areas, such as schools and hospitals, are off-limits to concealed carry. Michigan recognizes resident licenses from all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

### Self-Defense Laws in Michigan

### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Michigan adheres to the Castle Doctrine and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. This allows individuals to use deadly force without a duty to retreat, anywhere they have the legal right to be. Those who use a gun legitimately in self-defense are granted immunity from civil liability.

### Use of Non-Deadly Force

An individual not involved in a crime may use non-deadly force against another person anywhere they have the legal right to be, without a duty to retreat. This is permissible if the individual believes, honestly and reasonably, that such force is necessary to defend themselves or another person from imminent unlawful force.

### Use of Deadly Force

An individual not involved in a crime may use deadly force against another person anywhere they have the legal right to be, without a duty to retreat. This is permissible if the individual believes, honestly and reasonably, that such force is necessary to prevent:

  * Imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another person; or
  * Imminent sexual assault of themselves or another person.
