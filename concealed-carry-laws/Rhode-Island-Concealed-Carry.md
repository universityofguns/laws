### Summary of Rhode Island Gun Laws

Rhode Island operates under a shall-issue framework for concealed carry licenses, though the attorney general also has discretionary authority (‚Äúmay-issue‚Äù). Licenses are issued either by local police chiefs or the attorney general.

Under state law:

  * Local law enforcement must issue licenses to eligible applicants if they are deemed suitable and have a valid reason for carrying a handgun.
  * The attorney general may issue licenses to individuals aged 21 or older who demonstrate a specific need and prove their ability to handle a handgun. This license may be issued to undocumented individuals as well.

### Handgun Purchase and Background Checks

To purchase a handgun in Rhode Island:

  * A Rhode Island License to Carry Concealed Weapons (LCCW) or a ‚Äúblue card‚Äù from the RI Department of Environmental Management is required.
  * A background check through the state police or local chief of police is mandatory for private handgun purchases.
  * Firearms registration is not mandatory in Rhode Island.



### Concealed and Open Carry Laws

  * Open carry is legal only with an LCCW issued by the attorney general. Local authorities issue licenses strictly for concealed carry.
  * Applicants must justify their need for a firearm and provide three notarized references. A firearms training course with a live-firing test is mandatory.
  * Non-residents with a valid permit from their home state can apply for an LCCW through local law enforcement. The attorney general may issue LCCWs to non-residents without home state permits.
  * Certain locations are off-limits for carrying firearms, such as state parks and federal buildings.



### Self-Defense Laws in Rhode Island

Rhode Island follows the Castle Doctrine:

  * There is no duty to retreat for the owner, tenant, or occupier of a place when facing a threat and may use reasonable means of self-defense.
  * It is legally presumed in any civil or criminal proceeding that the use of force in self-defense was justified against someone committing specific criminal offenses, such as burglary or intent to commit murder.



These laws afford individuals legal protections when using force in self-defense within their homes or places of lawful occupancy.
