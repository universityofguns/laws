### Summary of Nevada Gun Laws

### Nevada Firearm Laws

Nevada operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, which are issued at the county level.

### Private Firearm Sales

No permit or firearms registration is required for buying a handgun from a private individual in Nevada. However, since January 2, 2020, all sales must be processed through a licensed federal firearms dealer with a background check, excluding temporary transfers and transfers between immediate family members.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Nevada without a permit for individuals 18 years and older who can legally possess a firearm. It is permitted in most public spaces except certain prohibited areas such as school premises and legislative buildings. Firearms carried openly in vehicles must not be concealed on the person without a concealed firearms permit.

### Concealed Carry Permits

Residents of Nevada and non-residents with recognized licenses/permits may legally carry concealed firearms. Applicants must be 21 years old (18 for military), complete an approved firearm safety course, and demonstrate handgun proficiency. Some areas like school premises and public airports are off-limits for concealed carry.

### Justifiable Homicide and Self-Defense

In Nevada, homicide is justifiable in cases of necessary self-defense or defense of occupied habitation, motor vehicle, or against a person manifestly intending violence. The use of deadly force is permissible under these circumstances provided the defender is not the aggressor, has the right to be present, and is not engaged in criminal activity.

### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Nevada upholds the Castle Doctrine and ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù principles, permitting individuals to use force, including deadly force, without retreating if faced with a threat inside their home or workplace. The force used must be immediately necessary and a reasonable response to the aggressor‚Äôs actions.

### Immunity from Civil Liability

Individuals using force likely to cause death or bodily injury against an aggressor are immune from civil liability if such force was justified under Nevada law.

These provisions aim to protect individuals‚Äô rights to self-defense within the boundaries of Nevada‚Äôs legal framework.

**Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?**

  * Does Nevada have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs?

In addition, it is illegal to inhale, ingest, apply or otherwise use any chemical, poison or organic solvent, or any compound or combination of any of these, to a degree which renders you incapable of safely exercising actual physical control of a firearm. This prohibition does not apply to the actual physical possession of a firearm by a person who was within the person‚Äôs personal residence and had the firearm in his or her possession solely for self-defense.
  * [Nev. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 202.257]
  * As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgement, slow your reaction times or impact your decision-making abilities.
