### Summary of North Dakota Gun Laws

### NORTH DAKOTA CONCEALED CARRY LAWS

North Dakota operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry licenses, where the attorney general oversees issuance, with some discretion for law enforcement to deny based on perceived risks.

Permits, firearms registration, or background checks aren‚Äôt required for purchasing handguns privately.

Open carry of handguns is legal for residents with a Concealed Weapon License (CWL) and non-residents with a valid resident concealed carry license from a recognized state. Minimum age for carry is 18, with some areas such as bars off-limits.

### CONCEALED CARRY DEFINITION

In North Dakota, concealed carry is defined as carrying a weapon in a manner not discernible by ordinary observation. Permitless concealed carry is allowed for both residents and non-residents as of August 1st, 2023. Individuals must carry a driver‚Äôs license or state ID and inform law enforcement of firearm possession during any in-person contact.

### CLASSES OF CWLS

North Dakota issues Class 1 and Class 2 CWLs. Class 1 permits have broader reciprocity due to additional testing requirements. Both licenses require completion of a state-certified firearms training course.

### RECIPROCITY ISSUES

There‚Äôs ongoing clarification regarding permit reciprocity. As of August 1, 2021, North Dakota recognizes permits from states it honors. However, nuances exist regarding non-resident permits, with ongoing updates influencing reciprocity.

### USE OF FORCE LAWS

North Dakota allows force to prevent unlawful entry, property damage, or theft. Individuals using force justifiably are immune from civil liability for injuries or deaths caused to intruders.

### SELF-DEFENSE LAWS

Under North Dakota law, individuals may use force against imminent bodily harm, sexual assault, or unlawful detention. The state supports a Stand Your Ground law, effective August 1, 2021, removing the duty to retreat in places one legally occupies.

### DEADLY FORCE

Deadly force is justified to prevent death, serious injury, or violent felonies against oneself or others. Individuals must avoid using excessive force and attempt retreat unless safety is jeopardized.

North Dakota upholds laws that protect individuals‚Äô rights to self-defense and secure living environments.

There is currently some confusion about ND reciprocity. The ND Attorney General‚Äôs website indicates that in accordance with N.D.C.C. ¬ß 62.1‚Äì04‚Äì03.1, North Dakota will honor a valid concealed carry license/permit (resident and non-resident) issued by a state that has agreed to recognize a North Dakota license. However, HB 1293 (which took effect on August 1, 2021) included the following language, ‚Äúan individual may carry a firearm concealed under this chapter if the individual qualifies for reciprocity under section 62.1‚Äì04‚Äì03.1 and the individual has the equivalent of a class 2 firearm and dangerous weapon license from the state in which the individual is a resident.‚Äù

Therefore, the USCCA map shows the more conservative version until this issue is resolved.

### Class 1/Class 2 Licenses

**Class 1/Class 2 Licenses**  
The only difference between a Class 1 license and a Class 2 license is reciprocity. Both licenses are equally valid within North Dakota, but because of additional testing requirements, the holders of a Class 1 license have reciprocity in many more states than those who hold a Class 2 license.

**Note:** An individual who has a valid Class 2 license may apply to upgrade to a Class 1 license within 5 years from the date the Class 2 license was issued, by completing the additional testing requirements of a Class 1 license and submitting an application form along with the $60 application fee and required documents.

### Non-Resident Concealed Carry licenses:

North Dakota issues licenses to full-time active military duty stationed in ND and residents of states which have reciprocity with North Dakota, provided the individual possesses a valid concealed carry permit from that state. However, all testing must take place within the state of ND and cannot be held in conjunction with testing for any other state. The application must be submitted to the BCI within 30 days of the testing date.

### Name/Address Changes:

Bismarck, ND 58502**

For security reasons, the BCI can only accept a change of address notification received by mail.

If you would like a replacement license with your new address, you must send in the old license with your address change letter. If you do not send in the old license, the BCI will not issue an updated license. You are not required to get an updated license ‚Äî your license is still valid even if it has your old address. If you send in your license to have it updated, you cannot carry concealed until you receive the updated license. Please allow 2‚Äì3 weeks for the updated license to be issued.
