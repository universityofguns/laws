### Summary of New Jersey Gun Laws

New Jersey has transitioned to a shall-issue state for concealed weapons permits, issued locally by municipal police departments or the NJ State Police. Applicants must secure approval from their local police chief and present their application to a superior court judge.

### Firearm Purchases and Ammunition

A Firearms Purchaser Identification (FPID) card and a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) conducted through a licensed firearms dealer are required to purchase handguns privately. Handgun purchases in New Jersey must be from a state-licensed dealer or a resident private seller, with records submitted to the State Police Firearms Investigations Unit. An FPID is also necessary to buy handgun ammunition.

### Use of Force in Defense of Personal Property

Force is justifiable to prevent theft, criminal mischief, or other criminal interference with personal property.

### Use of Force to Protect a Third Person

Force is justified if necessary to protect another person from imminent harm, provided the person being protected would be justified in using such force themselves.

### Use of Force in Defense of Premises

Justifiable when defending premises from criminal trespass, with deadly force justifiable under specific circumstances such as preventing arson, burglary, or robbery.

### Use of Force in Defense of Dwelling

Force or deadly force against an intruder unlawfully in a dwelling is justifiable if the actor reasonably believes it is necessary to protect against imminent harm.

### Use of Force for Protection of Person

Justifiable when necessary to protect against unlawful force, with deadly force permissible when facing imminent death or serious bodily harm, and retreat is not mandatory if the actor is in their dwelling and not the aggressor.
