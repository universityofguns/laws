### Summary of Massachusetts Gun Laws

Massachusetts became a shall-issue state following the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen case on June 23rd, 2022. Licenses to Carry (LTC) are issued at the local police station or, for non-residents, through the State Police Firearms Records Bureau.

A Firearm Identification (FID) card or LTC is required to purchase a firearm. Background checks are mandatory for buying a handgun from a private individual, as the seller must verify the buyer‚Äôs Firearm Identification Card with the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services. An LTC is also required to purchase ammunition. Although handguns do not need to be registered, all firearm sales and transfers must be reported to the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services, which maintains comprehensive records of these transactions.

The former Class B license allowed for the open carry of non-large capacity firearms. Although some Class B licenses may still be valid, no new Class B licenses are being issued due to revisions in licensure.

Concealed carry is legal in Massachusetts for individuals who have a Massachusetts LTC or a formerly issued, valid Class A LTC. The minimum age to obtain an LTC is 21 years old. LTCs are issued to both residents and non-residents and require a state-approved firearms training course. Some areas, such as schools and airports, are off-limits for carrying firearms. Massachusetts does not honor permits from any other states.

### Self-Defense

Massachusetts follows the Castle Doctrine. According to Massachusetts law, if a person who is an occupant of a dwelling is charged with killing or injuring someone who was unlawfully in the dwelling, it is a defense that the occupant was in the dwelling at the time of the offense and acted under the reasonable belief that the intruder was about to inflict great bodily injury or death. The occupant must have used reasonable means to defend themselves or another person lawfully in the dwelling. There is no duty to retreat within one‚Äôs own dwelling, but there is a duty to retreat outside of one‚Äôs home.

A ‚Äúdwelling‚Äù is defined as a building that serves as a permanent or temporary residence, which excludes tents, motor homes, and boats. Common areas of buildings, such as hallways, do not fall under the Castle Doctrine.

Massachusetts law provides an exception for the transportation of rifles and shotguns in or through the Commonwealth, provided the weapon is unloaded and in a locked container.
