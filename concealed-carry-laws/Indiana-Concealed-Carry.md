### Summary of Indiana Gun Laws

Indiana is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with licenses issued by the Indiana State Police.

There is no license required to purchase a firearm, and firearms do not need to be registered. Only Indiana residents or residents of neighboring states who are at least 18 years old can buy long guns. To buy a handgun, you must be at least 21 years old and a resident of Indiana.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal without a permit. As of July 1, 2022, individuals 18 years old or older who are not prohibited from carrying or possessing a handgun are no longer required to obtain a license to carry a handgun.

### Self-Defense

Indiana is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. There is no duty to retreat if deadly force is necessary to prevent serious bodily injury to oneself or a third person or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

### Defense of Self or Others

A person is justified in using reasonable force to protect themselves or a third person from what they reasonably believe to be the imminent use of unlawful force. Deadly force is justified if the person reasonably believes that it is necessary to prevent serious bodily injury to themselves or a third person or the commission of a forcible felony.

### Defense of Property

A person is justified in using reasonable force to prevent or terminate another person‚Äôs trespass on or criminal interference with property lawfully in their possession, the possession of a member of their immediate family, or belonging to a person whose property they have authority to protect. Deadly force is justified only if it is necessary to prevent serious bodily injury or the commission of a forcible felony.

### Immunity

No person in Indiana shall be placed in legal jeopardy of any kind for protecting themselves or a third person by reasonable means necessary.

### Defense of Place

A person is justified in using reasonable force, including deadly force, and does not have a duty to retreat if they reasonably believe that the force is necessary to prevent or terminate another person‚Äôs unlawful entry of or attack on their dwelling, curtilage, or occupied motor vehicle.
