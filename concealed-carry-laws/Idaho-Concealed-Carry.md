### Summary of Idaho Gun Laws

Idaho is a shall-issue state for concealed carry, with concealed weapon licenses issued at the local level by county sheriffs. No license is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, no background check is required, there is no waiting period, and there is no firearms registration in the state. Background checks are required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL). However, an Idaho Concealed Weapons License (CWL) exempts the holder from the federal requirement of a background check prior to the purchase of a firearm.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal without a license in Idaho for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including elementary schools and courthouses.

### Permitless Concealed Carry

Permitless concealed carry became legal as of March 2020. This allows any U.S. citizen over the age of 18 who can legally possess a firearm, or any current member of the armed forces of the United States, to lawfully carry a concealed firearm for self-defense without a license.

### Concealed Weapons Licenses (CWL)

Idaho offers two types of CWLs:

  1. **Standard CWL** : Covers concealed weapons including any dirk, dirk knife, bowie knife, dagger, pistol, revolver, or any other deadly or dangerous weapon.
  2. **Enhanced CWL** : Available for purposes of reciprocity for those who wish to travel out of state. Some states will only accept the enhanced version of Idaho‚Äôs license.



Both types require the applicant to be at least 18 years old. Idaho issues CWLs to residents and non-residents. Concealed carry licenses require a firearms training course that has been state-approved or experience with a firearm through participation in an organized shooting competition or military service.

### Self-Defense Laws

### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Idaho is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. A law-abiding citizen may stand his or her ground and protect himself or herself or a third party anywhere he or she has a legal right to be.

### Defense of Self and Others

No person in this state shall be placed in legal jeopardy for protecting oneself or family by reasonable means necessary, or when coming to the aid of another whom he reasonably believes to be in imminent danger of or the victim of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, murder, or other heinous crime. The defense of self or another does not require a person to wait until he or she ascertains whether the danger is apparent or real. A person confronted with such danger has a clear right to act upon appearances such as would influence the action of a reasonable person.

### Defense of Place

A person using force or deadly force in defense of a habitation, place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle is presumed to have acted reasonably and had a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury if the force is used against a person whose entry or attempted entry is unlawful and is made or attempted by use of force, in a violent and tumultuous manner, surreptitiously or by stealth, or for the purpose of committing a felony.

### Liability

A person is released from liability when protecting oneself or family by reasonable means necessary or when coming to the aid of another whom he or she reasonably believes to be in imminent danger of or the victim of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, murder, or other heinous crime.
