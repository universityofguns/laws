### Summary of Utah Gun Laws

### General Regulations

Utah is a shall-issue state, meaning that permits for carrying concealed firearms are issued by the Bureau of Criminal Identification. When buying a handgun from a private individual, no permit, background check, or firearms registration is required. Although the state has preemption, Salt Lake County has established a policy requiring background checks for private sales at the county‚Äôs three event facilities: Salt Palace Convention Center, Mountain America Expo Center, and Salt Lake County Equestrian Park.

### Recent Legislative Changes

On March 24, 2022, Governor Spencer Cox signed SB 115 into law, giving the state greater control over gun laws in Utah. This law allows the state to override policies established by local authorities, such as the policy set by Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson in 2019. The law took effect on July 1, 2022.

### Carrying Firearms

As of May 5, 2021, following the signing of HB 60 by Governor Cox, both open carry and concealed carry of a loaded firearm are legal for individuals at least 21 years old who can lawfully possess a firearm. Utah Concealed Firearm Permits (CFPs) are still available for those seeking reciprocity to carry in other states. Utah CFPs can be issued to residents aged 21 or older, or 18 for a provisional permit. Non-residents aged 21 or older who have a permit from their home state may also apply. Certain areas, including courthouses and secured areas of airports, are off-limits for carrying firearms. Obtaining a concealed carry permit requires completing a firearms familiarity course certified by the Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI). Since Utah has permitless carry, anyone aged 21 and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

### Self-Defense Laws

#### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Utah is a Castle Doctrine state, also known as a state with a ‚Äúdefense of habitation‚Äù law, and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. This means there is no duty to retreat if a person believes deadly force is necessary to prevent a felony in any place where they have a legal right to be.

#### Force in Defense of Person

An individual is justified in threatening or using force when they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or another person against the imminent use of unlawful force. Deadly force is justified only if the individual believes it is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to themselves or another person, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

#### Force in Defense of Property

A person is justified in using non-deadly force to prevent or terminate another person‚Äôs criminal interference with real or personal property that is:

  * Lawfully in the person‚Äôs possession,
  * Lawfully in the possession of a member of the person‚Äôs immediate family, or
  * Belonging to someone whose property the person has a legal duty to protect.



#### Civil and Criminal Immunity

Individuals using deadly force in defense of personal or real property are presumed to have acted reasonably and with a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury if the trespass or attempted trespass is unlawful and is made or attempted with force, or in a violent and tumultuous manner, or for the purpose of committing a forcible felony.

#### Force in Defense of Habitation

A person is justified in using force to prevent or terminate another‚Äôs unlawful entry into or attack upon their habitation. Deadly force is justified if:

  * The entry is made or attempted in a violent and tumultuous manner, surreptitiously, or by stealth, and the person reasonably believes the entry is for the purpose of assaulting or offering personal violence to anyone in the habitation.
  * The person reasonably believes the entry is for the purpose of committing a felony in the habitation and that force is necessary to prevent the felony.



#### Deadly Force in Defense of Persons on Real Property

Deadly force is justified in defense of persons on real property if:

  * The person is in lawful possession of the property,
  * The person reasonably believes force is necessary to prevent or terminate a trespass,
  * The trespass is made or attempted by force or in a violent and tumultuous manner,
  * The person reasonably believes the trespass is for the purpose of committing violence or a forcible felony that poses imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury to someone on the property.
