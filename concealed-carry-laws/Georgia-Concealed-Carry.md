### Summary of Georgia Gun Laws

Georgia is a shall-issue state with concealed weapons licenses issued at the county level and filed with the probate court in the county of residence. There is no license, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Georgia only with a Georgia Weapons Carry License (WCL) or a concealed carry permit from a state Georgia honors. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and courthouses. Open carry is not addressed in the constitutional carry bill that was signed into law on April 12, 2022.

### Concealed Carry

Concealed carry is legal for residents of Georgia with a WCL, any lawful weapons carrier, and non-residents with a license/permit issued by any other state. There is no firearms training required to obtain a Georgia WCL. You must be at least 21 years old (18 for members of the military) to get a concealed carry license in Georgia. No license is needed to carry a handgun in a person‚Äôs home, vehicle, place of business, while fishing or hunting, or unloaded in a case. The city of Kennesaw has a law enacted in 1982 requiring every head of household within city limits to maintain a firearm.

### Reciprocity

Governor Kemp signed HB 218 into law on April 12, 2022, recognizing firearms licenses from all other states. Holders of licenses that expired during the COVID state of emergency period must apply for a renewal license within 120 days of the expiration date on the face of the license.

### Constitutional Carry

On April 12, 2022, Gov. Brian Kemp signed SB 319 into law, permitting constitutional carry in Georgia. The law went into effect immediately.

### Self-Defense

### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Georgia is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù statute. There is no duty to retreat in defense of a forcible felony, such as rape, armed robbery, or kidnapping.

### Defense of Habitation

A person is justified in threatening or using force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that such threat or force is necessary to prevent or terminate another‚Äôs unlawful entry into or attack upon a habitation. Deadly force is justified only if:

  * The entry is made or attempted in a violent and tumultuous manner for the purpose of assaulting or offering personal violence to any person in the dwelling.
  * The force is used against another person who is not a member of the family or household and who unlawfully and forcibly enters or has entered the residence.
  * The person using such force reasonably believes that the entry is made or attempted for the purpose of committing a felony.



### Defense of Property Other Than Habitation

A person is justified in threatening or using force to the extent that he reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent or terminate trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with real property other than a habitation or personal property:

  * Lawfully in his possession or in the possession of a member of his immediate family.
  * Belonging to a person whose property he has a legal duty to protect.



The use of deadly force intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to prevent trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with real property other than a habitation or personal property is justified only if it is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

State law allows a license holder to possess a firearm in a motor vehicle parked in a parking facility of a government entity, courthouse, jail, prison, place of worship, bar or school safety zone, so long as the firearm is in the locked compartment of the vehicle, or in a locked container in or a locked firearms rack on the vehicle.
