### Summary of Alabama Gun Laws

Alabama generally operates as a shall-issue state with concealed weapons permits distributed at the county level by local sheriffs. However, a sheriff can deny a permit if the applicant is legally barred from owning a firearm under state or federal law or if there is a reasonable suspicion of potential misuse of the weapon.

Private handgun sales do not require a permit, background check, or registration. Open carry is permitted without a permit for those aged 19 or older who can legally possess a firearm, with certain locations like schools and courthouses being off-limits.

### Constitutional Carry

As of January 1, 2023, per HB 272, law-abiding residents and citizens aged 19 or older can carry a concealed pistol without a permit. The law does not specify a minimum age for carry. Under Alabama Code Section 13A-11‚Äì72, minors cannot possess firearms unless under adult supervision in specific scenarios.

### Concealed Carry

Residents with an Alabama Pistol Permit and non-residents with a recognized permit can carry concealed firearms. No firearms safety course is required for permit issuance. Sheriffs may issue permits to active-duty military personnel stationed in Alabama and their spouses. Military veterans can obtain or renew permits free of charge. Alabama honors all out-of-state concealed carry permits.

### Self-Defense

Alabama follows the Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground principles, allowing individuals to use force, including deadly force, without a duty to retreat if they are legally present and not engaged in unlawful activity.

### Civil and Criminal Immunity

Force used in self-defense, as justified under Alabama law, grants immunity from criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits unless deemed unlawful.

### Use of Force in Defense

Individuals can use physical force to defend themselves or others against unlawful force and can use deadly force in circumstances such as preventing unlawful deadly force, burglary, forcible entry, or imminent crimes like rape or robbery.

### Defense of Premises and Property

Lawful occupants can use force to prevent or terminate criminal trespass and may use deadly force to prevent arson on the premises. Non-deadly force is permissible to protect property other than premises.
