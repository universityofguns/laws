### Summary of California Gun Laws

California is now a shall-issue state since the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen on June 23rd, 2022. Licenses are issued by the county sheriff‚Äôs office or local police station.

Any resident of this state who has not previously reported ownership of a firearm or anyone moving into California with a firearm is considered a ‚Äúpersonal firearm importer‚Äù and must provide a report to the DOJ regarding their firearm or sell or transfer the firearm through a licensed dealer or to a sheriff or police department. The California Department of Justice (DOJ) runs a background check and retains information about the purchaser and seller of all in-state firearms sales and transfers.

All firearms sales must be completed through a dealer. A permit to purchase, a background check, and a transaction report to the DOJ are required to buy a handgun. No person may sell, loan, or transfer a firearm to a minor, nor sell a handgun to an individual under 21 years of age. All ammunition purchases require a DOJ ‚Äúpoint of sale‚Äù eligibility check with $1 paid by the consumer.

The open carry of firearms is governed in California by a set of laws that, at times, conflict with one another. Openly carrying loaded or unloaded firearms in public is generally prohibited in California. However, the sheriff of any county with a population under 200,000 people, or the chief of police of a city within that county, may issue licenses to carry a loaded, exposed handgun. Those licenses are only valid in the county where they are issued.

Concealed carry is only legal with a California Concealed Carry Weapons License (CCW). The minimum age is 18 years old, although a licensing authority has the discretion to require applicants to be older than 18 years of age. A CCWL may include any reasonable restrictions or conditions which the issuing authority deems warranted, including restrictions as to the time, place, manner, and circumstances under which the person may carry a firearm. Many areas are off-limits, including schools, courthouses, and businesses that sell alcohol for consumption. As of January 1, 2019, concealed carry licenses require a minimum eight-hour firearms training course that teaches California firearms laws and gun safety, including firing a gun in a ‚Äúlive-fire‚Äù shooting exercise at a shooting range. California issues carry licenses to residents, individuals who work in the state, and active duty military members permanently stationed in California. In terms of reciprocity, California does not honor any other states‚Äô concealed carry permits.

A U.S. citizen or legal resident at least 18 years old may carry a handgun anywhere within his or her place of residence, place of business, or on private property owned or lawfully possessed by the citizen or legal resident. A permit or license is not required for a person to carry within these locations.

  * The appellate court decision that struck down California‚Äôs ban on possessing large-capacity gun magazines has been vacated as a broader panel (en banc) of the court readies to rehear the San Diego-based case. While the ban on owning large-capacity magazines stays in place for now, a lower-court ruling that prohibits enforcement of the ban while the case is being litigated also remains in effect.

### Self-Defense

California is a Castle Doctrine state. The person using the force must have reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry occurred and has no duty to retreat. Though California does not have a stand-your-ground statute, the state appellate cases have held that there is no duty to retreat before using force in public. In addition, California Criminal Jury Instructions (CALCRIM) allow a jury to acquit someone based on a stand-your-ground defense. The instruction appears in CALCRIM #505 and #506, both of which deal with justifiable homicide.

Any person using force intended or likely to cause death or great bodily injury within his or her residence shall be presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily injury to self, family, or a member of the household when that force is used against another person, not a member of the family or household, who unlawfully and forcibly enters or has unlawfully and forcibly entered the residence and the person using the force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry occurred.

### Key State Laws

### Duty to Inform Officer You‚Äôre Carrying?

Do you have a duty to notify a police officer that you‚Äôre carrying a concealed firearm in California?

There is no duty to inform a police officer that you‚Äôre carrying a concealed firearm in California. However, some counties include a must-notify restriction on licenses.

### Preemption?

Does California have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e., Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?

Yes. Most, but not all, local restrictions are preempted. Local municipalities may enact ordinances prohibiting the possession of firearms and ammunition on county-owned property, banning the discharge of firearms, and zoning. [Cal. Gov. Code ¬ß 53701]

### Red Flag Law?

Does California have a red flag law?

Yes, California has a red flag law. An immediate family member of a person, a law enforcement officer, and as of September 1, 2020, coworkers and school administrators may file a petition that includes the seizure of both firearms and ammunition. The subject of the petition is banned from having in their custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm or ammunition for anywhere from one to five years. The subject is able to submit one written request per year for a hearing to terminate the restraining order. [Cal. Pen. Code ¬ß¬ß 18150]

### Carry While Using Alcohol or Controlled Substances?

Does California have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or controlled substances?

No consumption of alcohol is allowed. Specific controlled substances or narcotics, except when administered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the state to dispense, prescribe, or administer controlled substances, are not allowed. However, CCW license conditions indicate you cannot ‚Äúbe under the influence of any medication or drug, whether prescribed or not‚Äù. [Cal. Health and Safety Code ¬ß 11550 and the CCWL application form]. It is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

### Public Access to Concealed Carry Registry?

Does California allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?

Yes.

Does California state law define brandishing?

No definition of brandishing was found in California law. However, other than in an act of self-defense, any person who draws or exhibits a firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, in a rude, angry, or threatening manner, or unlawfully uses a firearm in any fight or quarrel is punishable by law. [Cal. Pen. Code ¬ß 417]

Contact your issuing authority for their consideration. CCWLs may be issued to individuals who work in the state and/or active duty military members permanently stationed in California.

### Driver‚Äôs License Linked to CCW License?

Is my California driver‚Äôs license linked to my California CCW license?

Yes. Although your California driver‚Äôs license is linked to your California concealed carry weapons license, that information is only included on specific types of searches that a law enforcement officer may run. You should not assume that an officer knows you are a concealed carry license holder upon contact. Additionally, CCW license conditions indicate that the licensee agrees not to refuse to show the license or surrender the concealed weapon to any peace officer upon demand.

Private party transfers, curio/relic handguns, certain single-action revolvers, and pawn/consignment returns are exempt from this requirement.

### Handgun Purchase Process

**Question:** What is the process for purchasing a handgun in California?

**Answer:**

  * There is a limitation of purchasing no more than one handgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle in any 30-day period, with exemptions including private party transfers.
  * All firearms purchases, including private transactions, must be conducted through a federally licensed firearms dealer (FFL). Purchasers must provide their California driver‚Äôs license, state-issued photo ID, or military identification with permanent duty station orders indicating a posting in California to the FFL. Additional proof of California residency is also required.
  * Prior to the submission of Dealer Record of Sale (DROS) information, purchasers must present a Firearm Safety Certificate (FSC) or provide proof of exemption (e.g., CCW license, active duty or honorably retired military, law enforcement).
  * Purchasers must complete both an ATF Form 4473 and a DROS Form. The purchaser will either be approved or, if found to be prohibited from possessing firearms, will receive a DOJ Prohibited Notice and Transfer Form.
  * The total state fee is $25, including a DROS fee of $31.19.

**Moving to California and interested in applying for a resident license? How soon can you apply?**  
California issues carry licenses to residents, individuals who work in the state, and active duty military members permanently stationed in California. You can apply for your license with your county sheriff or local police chief once you have established your residence, business, or principal place of employment in that county or city.

**Moving from one county in California to another county?**  
Per Pen. Code 26210, you must notify the licensing authority in writing within 10 days of any change in your place of residence. Your CCWL may not be revoked solely because your place of residence has changed to another county provided you haven‚Äôt breached any of the conditions or restrictions set forth in the license and you haven‚Äôt become prohibited by state or federal law from possessing, receiving, owning, or purchasing a firearm.

  * If your place of residence was the basis for issuance of a license, any license issued pursuant to Section 26150 or 26155 expires 90 days after you move from the county of issuance.
  * If the license is one to carry a loaded and exposed pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person, the license shall be revoked immediately upon a change of the licensee‚Äôs place of residence to another county.

### California Concealed Carry License Application Process

### Step 1:

Unlike most states that have a uniform statewide application process, the process in California is determined by each county and/or city issuing authority. You will need to contact your County Sheriff or Chief of Police to verify their application process. The process may require completion of a portion of the application so that a background check is completed and approval is received before you attend a training course. Your Sheriff or Police Department will also provide information on approved training courses/providers. Some issuing authorities have an online portal while others may not.

### Step 2:

Complete an approved training course. Depending on the issuing agency, this step may be done at the time of submitting the application or after step 6.

### Step 3:

Some jurisdictions may require psychological testing.

### Step 4:

Use the online licensing portal to submit your application or download the application and follow the instructions of your licensing authority regarding which sections to complete.

You will be required to provide Livescan/fingerprints at your issuing authority‚Äôs office or be approved to conduct Livescan/Fingerprints at a DOJ-authorized location.

### Step 6:

Upon completion of your background check, you will be notified within 90 days whether your application has been approved or denied. Please note that the timing of the background check approval varies greatly.

### License Restrictions and Conditions:

A California CCWL may include any reasonable restrictions or conditions which the issuing authority deems warranted, including restrictions as to the time, place, manner, and circumstances under which the person may carry a firearm. These restrictions must be indicated on the license itself. The license includes the licensee‚Äôs name, occupation, residence and business addresses, the licensee‚Äôs age, height, weight, color of eyes and hair, as well as a description of the weapon or weapons authorized to be carried, giving the name of the manufacturer, the serial number, and the caliber.

License holders agree to these state restrictions when they sign and submit the state application. While exercising the privileges granted under the terms of this license, the licensee shall not, when carrying a concealed weapon:

  * Consume any alcoholic beverage
  * Be in a place having a primary purpose of dispensing alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption

* * *

### California Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

### Step 1:

Renewals are the responsibility of the licensee and you may not receive any notification. Contact your issuing authority well in advance of your CCWL expiration date to determine how many days prior to expiration they recommend you submit your renewal (typically at least 30‚Äì90 days).

### Step 2:

Complete your 8-Hour CCWL Renewal Class.

### Step 3:

Additional psychological testing of an applicant seeking license renewal shall be required only if there is compelling evidence to indicate that a test is necessary.

### FAQ: California Concealed Carry Questions

**Hunter Harassment Law?**

Is there a Hunter Harassment Law in California? Yes. A person shall not willfully interfere with the participation of any individual in the lawful activity of shooting, hunting, fishing, falconry, hunting dog field trials, hunting dog training, or trapping at the location where that activity is taking place. ‚ÄúInterfere with‚Äù is defined as any action which physically impedes, hinders, or obstructs the lawful pursuit of any of the above-mentioned activities. [FGC ¬ß 2009]

**What Are the Knife Laws in California?**

All legal fixed-blade knives must be worn in plain view, except knives classified as dirks or daggers, which cannot be carried concealed and must be carried openly on a sheath around your waist. There is no open carry size limit for legal knives, although there may be local restrictions. Certain knives, including pocketknives with blades shorter than 2 inches, may be carried concealed as long as the blade is folded in the closed position. Switchblades with a blade longer than 2 inches are illegal to sell, carry and possess in any motor vehicle on public property. There are a number of types of knives that are illegal, including but not limited to ballistic knives, cane swords, billies, blackjacks, sandbags, sandclubs, saps, slungshots and nunchaku. [Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬ß 21510, 21310, 21110, 22210 & 22010]

**Carry While Gun Hunting?**

Can you concealed carry while shotgun/rifle hunting in California? Yes. Section 25400 does not apply to, or affect, licensed hunters or fishermen carrying pistols, revolvers, or other firearms capable of being concealed upon the person while engaged in hunting or fishing. However, these individuals may not carry or transport loaded firearms when going to or from the expedition. The unloaded firearms should be transported in the trunk of the vehicle or in a locked container other than the utility or glove compartment. [Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬ß 25610 and 25640]

**Possess Firearms at Walt Disney Resorts?**

Can you have a firearm at any Walt Disney Resort Properties? No. Firearms, ammunition, knives and weapons of any kind are prohibited at all Walt Disney World Resorts. This includes parking areas.

**Carry While Bow Hunting?**

Can you concealed carry while bow hunting in California? No. The California Fish and Game Commission voted to approve a petition submitted by NRA and CRPA attorneys seeking to allow big game archery hunters to carry a firearm for the purposes of self-defense while in the field. However, the Commission‚Äôs decision does not change the restriction as applied to deer hunting. A state statute outside of the Commission‚Äôs control prohibits any person other than specified law enforcement from carrying a firearm of any kind while archery hunting for deer.

**Wear a COVID Mask & Carry?**

I can legally carry a concealed firearm in California, but can I wear a COVID 19 protective mask while carrying concealed? California is one of just two states with statutes against carrying a concealed firearm while wearing a mask (the other being Illinois). However the law specifies that a person commits criminal possession of a firearm when the person carries a firearm in a public place or on any public street while masked so as to hide the person‚Äôs identity (which isn‚Äôt generally the intention during the COVID pandemic). However, since there is no exemption for wearing a mask for public health or medical reasons, contact your issuing authority with any questions. [Cal. Penal Code ¬ß 25300(a)]
