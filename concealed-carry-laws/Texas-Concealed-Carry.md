### Self-Defense Laws in Texas

Texas law supports both Castle Doctrine and ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù principles:

  * **Castle Doctrine** : No duty to retreat from any place where one has the legal right to be, when using force or deadly force to defend oneself or others.
  * **Defense of Person** : Deadly force is justified if the actor reasonably believes it is immediately necessary to prevent certain felonies or threats.
  * **Defense of Property** : Use of force, including deadly force, is justified to protect one‚Äôs property under specific circumstances.
  * **Presumption of Reasonableness** : Texas law presumes that using deadly force in defense of habitation, vehicle, or business against unlawful intrusion or felony is reasonable.
  * **Using Force** : Justified when necessary to protect against unlawful force, with a presumption of reasonableness under certain conditions.



For specific legal references, consult the Texas Penal Code (¬ß¬ß 9.31, 9.32, 9.33, 9.41, 9.42 & 9.43).

This includes school districts or open-enrollment charter schools per Texas Education Code ¬ß 37.0815 and institutions of higher education per Gov. Code ¬ß 411.2032, provided that the firearm or ammunition is not in plain view. There are exceptions, including oil and gas refineries. [Tex. Labor Code ¬ß 52.061]

**CARRY IN VEHICLE?**

Can you carry a concealed handgun in a vehicle in Texas?

Yes, without a license as of Sept. 1, 2021. However, it is an offense if the handgun is in plain view, unless it is in a holster and you are either 21 years old or have a Texas LTC or a permit that Texas honors, provided you are not engaging in criminal activity (other than a traffic violation). There are exemptions for peace officers, military, and other security and governmental professionals. [Texas Penal Code ¬ß¬ß 46.02(a-1) and 46.15]

**CARRY AT ROADSIDE REST AREAS?**

Can you carry a concealed firearm at roadside rest areas in Texas?

Yes, without a license for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a handgun.

**CARRY IN STATE/NATIONAL PARKS, STATE/NATIONAL FORESTS AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREAS (WMAS)?**

Can you carry a concealed firearm in state/national parks, state/national forests, and Wildlife Management Areas in Texas?

Yes, without a license for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a handgun. See the National Parks webpage for links to each Park in Texas.

Carry is prohibited in businesses that sell alcoholic beverages for on-premise consumption, whose alcohol sales constitute more than 50% of gross receipts, and display a red sign with ‚Äú51%‚Äù in large red letters superimposed over a warning that possession of a concealed weapon on the premises is a felony. As of Sept. 1, 2021, only permit holders have a legal defense if effective notice is not given by the business. You can concealed carry in the restaurant area of an eatery that serves alcohol (those that make less than 51% of their profits from alcohol) without a license. [Texas Penal Code ¬ß 46.03(p)]

### Key State Laws

**DRIVER‚ÄôS LICENSE LINKED TO Carry License?**

  * Is my Texas driver‚Äôs license linked to my Texas carry license?
  * Yes. Texas does show if the registered driver of the car has a license to carry (LTC). So when pulled over, the license plate trace shows that data. If the DL is run independently of a license plate it will also show that you have a LTC.



**‚ÄúNo Weapons Allowed‚Äù Signs Enforced?**

  * Are ‚ÄúNo Weapons Allowed‚Äù signs enforced in Texas?
  * Yes. As of Sept. 1, 2021, signage is complicated in Texas, and anyone carrying a firearm will need to understand the differences between the definitions of each sign. The Firearm Carry Act of 2021 creates two additional weapons signs: Texas Penal Code ¬ß 30.05 signs will indicate locations where just permitless carry of firearms is prohibited. It will be up to private individuals and businesses to decide what their policies will be moving forward regarding permitless carriers. Texas Penal Code ¬ß 30.06 signs that indicate locations where concealed carry permit holders cannot carry; Texas Penal Code ¬ß 30.07 signs that indicate locations where open carry for permit holders is prohibited; and 51% signs that indicate the establishment sells alcohol by the drink and receives more than 51% of its income from alcohol sales. Only concealed carry permit holders have a legal defense if effective notice has not been provided. [Texas Penal Code ¬ß 46.15(p)] Texas Penal Code ¬ß 46.03(o) signs will state ‚ÄúPursuant to Section 46.03, Penal Code (places weapons prohibited), a person may not carry a firearm or other weapon on this property.‚Äù If this sign is posted in a conspicuous location, no firearms are allowed. Regardless of which sign is posted, once a person receives effective consent (either verbal or written notice) that entry on the property is prohibited, he or she must promptly leave or risk being charged with a misdemeanor. [Texas Penal Code ¬ß 30.05]



**Red Flag Law?**

  * Does Texas have a red flag law?
  * No. Texas does not have a red flag law.



**Brandishing?**

  * Does Texas state law define brandishing?
  * No definition of brandishing was found in Texas law. However, a person commits disorderly conduct if he or she intentionally or knowingly displays a firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm. [Tex. Pen. Code ¬ß 42.01]



**NON-RESIDENT PERMITTING?**

  * Does Texas issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?
  * Yes. The process is the same as for residents.



**PUBLIC ACCESS TO CONCEALED CARRY REGISTRY?**

  * Does Texas allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?
  * No, however, the information is available to any criminal justice agency.



**Preemption?**

  * Does Texas have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e. Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?
  * Yes, the state has preemption of firearms laws in Texas, except local municipalities may: Regulate the discharge of firearms within their limits, other than at a sport shooting range; Regulate the carrying of a firearm or air gun by a person other than a person licensed to carry a concealed handgun under Texas law at: A public park; A public meeting of a municipality, county, or other governmental body; A political rally, parade or official political meeting; and A non-firearms-related school, college, or professional athletic event. In addition, in any county building that houses a justice court, county court, county court at law, or district court, or in any office used by these courts, any person who possesses a firearm without the court‚Äôs written authorization, or without complying with any written regulation of the court, is subject to criminal liability. Based on an Attorney General opinion, counties may prohibit concealed handgun license holders from carrying concealed handguns in county parks and rapid transit authorities may prohibit concealed handgun licensees from carrying handguns while on public transportation. [Tex. Local Gov‚Äôt Code ¬ß 229.001(b)(6)][Tex. Local Gov‚Äôt Code ¬ß 291.010(c)]



**Duty to Inform Officer You‚Äôre Carrying?**

  * Do you have a duty to inform a police officer that you‚Äôre carrying a concealed firearm in Texas?
  * You have a duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you‚Äôre carrying a concealed firearm in Texas when an officer demands that you display identification, you must display both your driver‚Äôs license or identification and your handgun license. [Tex. Gov‚Äôt Code ¬ß 411.205]



**Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?**

  * Does Texas have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs?
  * As of Sept. 1, 2021, carry is prohibited if you are intoxicated anywhere other than: On your own property or property under your control or on private property with the consent of the owner; or Inside of or directly en route to a motor vehicle or watercraft: That is owned by you or under your control; or That is owned by you or under your control; or With the consent of the owner or operator of the vehicle or watercraft. [Texas Penal Code ¬ß 46.02(a-6)] ‚ÄúIntoxicated‚Äù is defined as: Not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a dangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other substance into the body; or Having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more. [Texas Penal Code ¬ß 49.01(2)] As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times or impact your decision-making abilities.
