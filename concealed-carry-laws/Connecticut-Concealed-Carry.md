### Summary of Connecticut Gun Laws

### Connecticut Gun Laws

Connecticut operates as a may-issue state, where local law enforcement has discretion in granting handgun carry permits based on a ‚Äúsuitability clause‚Äù. This clause applies to both new permit issuance and revocations. Obtaining a permit involves a two-step process: first, applying for a temporary permit locally, and then submitting another application at the state level through the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP).

### Handgun Purchase Requirements

To purchase a handgun in Connecticut, one must hold a Connecticut Pistol Permit (CTPP) or obtain a Certificate of Eligibility for Pistol and Revolvers or Long Guns or Ammunition. Private handgun sales necessitate a background check performed by a federally licensed dealer.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed carry is permitted in Connecticut with a CTPP, with a minimum age requirement of 21. As of October 1, 2023, open carry is illegal. Both residents and non-residents with a valid CCW license from their home state can apply for a CTPP. Certain locations, such as schools and state parks, are off-limits for concealed carry. Applicants must complete a state-approved firearms training course that includes live-fire exercises. Connecticut does not recognize permits from other states.

### Use of Physical Force

### Defense of Person

Individuals may use reasonable physical force to defend themselves or others from imminent physical force. Deadly force is only justified if there is a reasonable belief that the other person is using or about to use deadly force or inflict great bodily harm.

### Defense of Property

Reasonable physical force can be used to prevent attempted larceny or criminal mischief involving property. Deadly force is permissible only in defense of a person, not property.

### Defense of Premises

Persons in control of premises can use reasonable physical force to prevent or stop criminal trespass. Deadly force is allowed under specific circumstances, including defense against a trespasser committing arson or a violent crime, or to prevent unlawful entry into a dwelling or place of work.

[Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann ¬ß¬ß 53a-19, 53a-20 & 53a-21]

### Self-Defense

Connecticut incorporates the Castle Doctrine, which allows individuals to use physical force in defense of their premises without a duty to retreat. However, outside of one‚Äôs home, there is a duty to retreat before resorting to physical force.
