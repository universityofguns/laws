### Summary of New Hampshire Gun Laws

New Hampshire operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Residents apply to the local law enforcement office and non-residents to the State Department of Justice for a Pistol/Revolver License (PRL).

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required to purchase a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal in New Hampshire without a license for individuals at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. While there is no minimum age to carry a firearm under state law, federal law requires individuals to be at least 18 years old. Pistol/Revolver Licenses (PRLs) are issued to residents and non-residents primarily for reciprocity purposes. No fingerprinting or photograph is necessary for a PRL. New Hampshire law does not mandate firearms safety training or proficiency demonstration for license applicants. With permitless carry in place, any person aged 18 and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry concealed without a license or permit.

### Self-Defense Laws

New Hampshire implements a Castle Doctrine and ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. Individuals lawfully present in a place and facing a threat of bodily harm or death are not obligated to retreat before using force.

### Use of Force in Defense of Premises

A person in control of premises, or who is licensed or privileged to be there, may use non-deadly force to prevent or stop criminal trespassing. Deadly force may be used to defend against a person or to prevent arson, but only under circumstances where non-deadly force is insufficient.

### Civil Immunity

Individuals who use force in self-defense, defense of others, protection of premises, law enforcement, or for the care of minors are immune from civil liability for injuries sustained by an aggressor.

[N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ¬ß 627:4, 62:5, 627:6, 627:7, and 627:1a]

### Physical Force in Defense of a Person

Non-deadly force is justified to defend oneself or others against imminent unlawful force. Deadly force is justified if one reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent:

  * Unlawful deadly force against oneself or another person.
  * Any unlawful force during a burglary or forcible sex offense.
  * Unlawful force during the commission of a felony within one‚Äôs dwelling or its curtilage.



Deadly force is not justified if safe retreat is possible, the person is not the initial aggressor, or other alternatives are available.

The terms ‚Äúcurtilage‚Äù and ‚Äúdwelling‚Äù are defined to include structures closely associated with overnight accommodation and surrounding grounds habitually used for domestic purposes.

These laws apply regardless of whether the individual is physically present.
