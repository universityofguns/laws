### Summary of Colorado Gun Laws

### Concealed Carry Permits

Colorado is a shall-issue state where concealed carry permits are issued by local sheriff’s offices to county residents. There are no purchase permits or firearms registration requirements for handguns. Non-residents can obtain a concealed carry permit if they hold a valid permit from a state recognized by Colorado. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and not prohibited by law from possessing a firearm. A state-approved firearms training course is mandatory for obtaining a concealed carry permit.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Colorado for individuals aged 18 or older who can legally possess a firearm, except in Denver County and other areas where signage prohibits it. Local governments have the authority to regulate open carrying within their jurisdiction, provided appropriate signage is displayed.

### Self-Defense Laws

Colorado follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing individuals to expect absolute safety within their homes. There is no duty to retreat, and this principle applies within one’s residence or any other occupied dwelling. While Colorado does not explicitly have a stand your ground law, the Colorado Supreme Court has clarified that individuals acting in self-defense are not required to retreat and can stand their ground.

### Use of Force in Defense

  * **Defense of Property:** Individuals may use reasonable force to prevent theft, criminal mischief, or tampering involving property. Deadly force is permissible in defense of oneself or others.
  * **Defense of Person:** Reasonable force can be used to defend against unlawful physical force. Individuals are justified in using the necessary degree of force to protect themselves or others.
  * **Defense Against an Intruder:** Any occupant of a dwelling can use any level of force, including deadly force, if they reasonably believe an intruder has unlawfully entered and is committing a crime or poses a threat of physical force.
  * **Defense of Premises:** Property owners or those in control of premises can use reasonable force to prevent unlawful trespassing. Deadly force is only justified to prevent a trespasser from committing first-degree arson.

### Civil and Criminal Immunity

Individuals who use justified physical force, including deadly force, in accordance with Colorado law are immune from criminal prosecution and civil liability for injuries or deaths resulting from such actions.

[Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18–1–704, 18–1–704.5, 18–1–705 & 18–1–706]

### Self-Defense Laws in Colorado

Colorado adheres to the Castle Doctrine, providing its residents with the right to anticipate absolute safety within their residences. There is no obligation to retreat under Colorado law, which extends to both one’s home and any other inhabited structure. While Colorado does not explicitly enforce a stand your ground law, the Colorado Supreme Court has upheld that individuals acting in self-defense are not required to retreat and are permitted to stand their ground, especially when they are not the aggressors in the situation.
