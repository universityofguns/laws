### Permitless Carry Law

As of July 1, 2021, Tennessee enacted a law allowing permitless open and concealed carry for individuals aged 18 and older, who can lawfully possess a handgun, provided they are in a place they have the right to be and meet additional specified criteria. Some areas remain off-limits, including government buildings and schools.

### Legal Challenge and Changes

In April 2021, the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) filed a lawsuit against Tennessee’s restrictions on 18- to 20-year-olds carrying concealed firearms in public. On January 23, 2023, the state and FPC reached an agreement in federal court stating these restrictions were unconstitutional and immediately ceased enforcement.

### Tennessee Concealed Handgun Carry Permits

Since January 1, 2020, Tennessee offers two levels of concealed handgun carry permits:

  * **Concealed Handgun Carry Permit (CHCP)** : Requires a 90-minute online course.
  * **Enhanced Handgun Carry Permit (EHCP)** : Requires completion of an 8-hour live training course, allowing permittees to carry openly or concealed in more locations.



Non-residents who work regularly in Tennessee and hold a valid concealed carry permit in their home state may apply for a CHCP after six months of employment.

### Reciprocity

Tennessee recognizes concealed carry permits from all other states.

### Self-Defense Laws

Tennessee adheres to Castle Doctrine principles and has a “stand your ground” law:

  * Individuals lawfully present and not engaged in illegal activity have no duty to retreat before using or threatening force likely to cause serious bodily injury or death.
  * Deadly force used within a residence, business, dwelling, or vehicle is presumed justified against an intruder unlawfully and forcibly entering.



### Definitions

  * **Dwelling** : Includes any structure with a roof, designed for human use.
  * **Residence** : A dwelling where a person resides temporarily or permanently.
  * **Vehicle** : Self-propelled motor vehicles for public highway use.



[Tenn. Code. Ann. §§ 39–11–611, 39–11–612, 39–11–614]

  * Carry in places of worship? **There is no state statute prohibiting concealed carry in places of worship. However, since places of worship are private property, they may post signs prohibiting firearms.**



**Enhanced HCP holders** are allowed to carry in the locations covered by Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 39–17–1309(e)(8), 39–17–1311(b)(1)(H), and (b)(1)(I) which includes public parks, public natural areas, historic parks, nature trails or recreational areas, campgrounds, national parks, forests, greenways, waterways (with some exceptions, including Tennessee Valley Authority and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers properties), and other similar public places that are owned or operated by the state, a county, a municipality, or instrumentality of the state, a county, or municipality.​ There may be occasions when carry is not allowed in these locations, including when the area is being used by a school or if access to the area is restricted for an event, such as a state fair.

A “greenway” is defined as an open-space area following a natural or manmade linear feature designed to be used for recreation, transportation, conservation, and to link services and facilities. A greenway is a paved, gravel-covered, wood chip covered, or wood-covered path that connects one greenway entrance with another greenway entrance. In the event a greenway traverses a park that is owned or operated by a county, municipality, or instrumentality thereof, the greenway shall be considered a portion of that park unless designated otherwise by the local legislative body.

A permit holder must have the permit in the holder’s immediate possession at all times when carrying a handgun in a location or manner that would be prohibited if not for the person’s status as either as a concealed handgun carry permit holder or as an enhanced handgun carry permit holder and must display the permit on demand of a law enforcement officer under such circumstances. [Tennessee Code Annotated § 39–17–1309, 39–17–1310 and 39–17–1311(b)(1)(H) and (b)(1)(I)]
