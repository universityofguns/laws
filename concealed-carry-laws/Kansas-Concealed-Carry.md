  * Those under 21 may only conceal carry on their own property, during firearms safety courses, at established ranges, or while hunting.



### Self-Defense Laws

Kansas adheres to Castle Doctrine and “stand your ground” principles:

  * **Defense of Dwelling, Place of Work, or Occupied Vehicle:** Justified use of force to prevent unlawful entry or attack.
  * **Self-Defense:** Justified use of force to defend against imminent unlawful force; deadly force permitted to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.

These laws empower individuals to defend themselves and their property under reasonable circumstances throughout Kansas.
