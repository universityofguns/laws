### Summary of Vermont Gun Laws

Vermont is a does-not-issue, constitutional carry state. All gun sales must be completed through a licensed firearms dealer unless the transfer is to a family member. Buyers under 21 years old must have completed a Vermont hunters course (or equivalent) or be a member or former member of the military, active or veteran member of the National Guard, or law enforcement. Vermont does not require permits to purchase and has no firearms registration.

### Open Carry and Concealed Carry

Both open carry and concealed carry are legal without a permit in Vermont. Any person 16 or older (although federal law requires the age to be 18) who can legally possess a firearm is allowed to carry openly or concealed. There is no distinction between resident or non-resident; both are allowed to carry without a permit in Vermont. Therefore, the state does not issue permits.

  * In the just and necessary defense of his or her own life or the life of his or her husband, wife, parent, child, brother, sister, master, mistress, servant, guardian, or ward; or
