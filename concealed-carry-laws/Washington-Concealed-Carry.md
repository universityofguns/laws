### Summary of Washington Gun Laws

Washington is a shall-issue state where licenses are issued locally by sheriffs or police departments.

### Carrying and Displaying Firearms

It is illegal to carry or display a firearm in a manner that suggests intent to intimidate or causes alarm. Exceptions include self-defense against unlawful force.

### Open Carry and Restrictions

Open carry without a license is legal for those 21 and older, but prohibited in certain places like schools and courthouses. Recent legislation (SB 5038) also bans open carry at the Capitol, legislative offices, hearings, meetings, and within 250 feet of permitted demonstrations. A valid permit is required to carry a loaded handgun in any vehicle.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Residents with a Washington Concealed Pistol License (CPL) and non-residents with recognized permits can legally carry concealed. CPLs are available to those 21 and older without mandatory firearms training. Exceptions for carrying without a license include one’s home or business.

### Self-Defense and Use of Force

Washington lacks a specific castle law but permits self-defense without a duty to retreat when lawfully present and under threat. Use of force is justified to prevent offenses or detain intruders on one’s property, provided it’s proportionate to the threat.

### Justifiable Homicide and Defending Against Violent Crime

Homicide is justifiable in defense against imminent felony or danger to persons in a dwelling. Washington law protects individuals using reasonable force to defend themselves, family, or property against violent crimes without legal jeopardy.
