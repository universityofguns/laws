### Summary of Louisiana Gun Laws

Louisiana is a shall-issue state. Concealed weapons permits are processed at the state level by the Department of Public Safety.

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

The state of Louisiana does not prohibit the open carry of firearms in public. Therefore, it is legal in Louisiana without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old who is not prohibited from possessing a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including parades and bars.

Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Louisiana Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP) and for non-residents with a permit/license from a state recognized by Louisiana. As of August 1st, 2022, constitutional carry is legal for resident active duty military and veterans only. However, on March 5th, 2024, the governor signed a permitless carry bill into law, making Louisiana a constitutional carry state. The law will take effect on July 4th, 2024. CHPs are available for residents and members of the military permanently stationed in Louisiana; non-resident permits are not available. Applicants must be at least 21 years old, a resident of Louisiana, and complete a firearms training course. There are exemptions for non-residents who are in the military and have a Louisiana driver‚Äôs license or Louisiana state ID. Louisiana honors permits issued by states that recognize Louisiana permits.

### Use of Force in Defense

The use of force is justifiable under either of the following circumstances:

  * When committed for the purpose of preventing a forcible offense against the person or a forcible offense or trespass against property in a person‚Äôs lawful possession, provided that the force or violence used must be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent such offense.
  * When committed by a person against an unlawful entry into the dwelling, place of business, or motor vehicle, and the person using the force or violence reasonably believes that the use of force or violence is necessary to prevent the entry or to compel the intruder to leave the dwelling, place of business, or motor vehicle.



### Self-Defense

Louisiana is a Castle Doctrine state with a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù statute. There is no duty to retreat in any place a person has the legal right to be before using force or violence, and a person may meet force with force.

### Defense of Others

It is justifiable to use deadly force when it is reasonably apparent that the person attacked could have justifiably used such means himself, and when it is reasonably believed that such intervention is necessary to protect the other person.
