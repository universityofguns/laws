### Summary of Hawaii Gun Laws

### Handgun Purchase and Possession

To purchase a handgun from a private individual in Hawaii, a permit to purchase, background check, and firearms registration are required. There is a mandatory 14-day waiting period for purchase permits. All firearms and ammunition must be registered with the county‚Äôs Chief of Police where the possessor resides, works, or is temporarily staying.

### Non-Resident Firearm Possession

Non-residents can transport firearms into Hawaii if they possess a hunting license, shooting preserve permit, invitation to shoot on private land, or written notification from a firing range. Registration at a police station within 72 hours of arrival is mandatory. Each firearm‚Äôs make, model, and serial number must be licensed.

### Open and Concealed Carry

Hawaii permits both open and concealed carry of handguns with a Hawaii license to carry, valid only within the county of issue. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and complete a state-approved firearms training course for concealed carry licenses.

### Legal Challenges and Reciprocity

The state and counties of Hawaii have sought rehearing of the Young v. Hawaii court case by the Ninth Circuit due to restrictive handgun permitting policies. Hawaii does not issue non-resident licenses nor recognize CCW licenses from other states.

### Self-Defense

Hawaii follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing individuals to use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves inside their home or place of business without a duty to retreat. Outside these locations, retreat is required if it can be done safely.

### Protection of Others

Force can be used to protect others if the actor believes it‚Äôs necessary and the person being protected would also be justified in using protective force. Similar to self-defense, retreat is required if safe and feasible.

### Protection of Property

Force is justified to prevent unlawful entry or theft of property in the actor‚Äôs possession or another‚Äôs possession they‚Äôre protecting. Deadly force can only be used to prevent serious crimes involving threats of deadly force.

These laws outline the rights and responsibilities of gun owners and individuals using force for protection under Hawaii state statutes.
