### Summary of Arizona Gun Laws

Arizona is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with concealed weapons permits issued at the state level by the Department of Public Safety.

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual. A purchaser must be at least 18 years old to buy a gun from a private individual. The minimum age to purchase a handgun from a federally licensed dealer is 21.

Open carry is legal in Arizona for any person who is at least 18 years old and who can legally possess a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and liquor stores that have posted ‚Äúno weapons‚Äù signs.

Anyone at least 21 years old who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Arizona Concealed Weapons Permits (CWP) are issued to residents and non-residents at least 21 years old or 19 for active military and veterans and require a state-approved firearms training course, although there are training exemptions that may apply to law enforcement and members of the military. Since Arizona has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

### Civil Immunity

No person in Arizona is subject to civil liability for engaging in justified self-defense conduct.

### Carry/Possess at a Hotel

**Question:** Can you carry or possess a firearm on hotel property in Arizona?

**Answer:** Arizona statutes don‚Äôt specifically address firearms at hotels. Each hotel develops its own policies, so you should contact the individual hotel to inquire about its concealed carry policy.

### Store in a Vehicle in an Employee Parking Lot

**Question:** Does Arizona have laws relating to storing firearms in private vehicles in an employee parking lot?

**Answer:** Firearms can legally be carried in a case, holster, scabbard, pack, or luggage that is carried within a means of transportation or within a storage compartment, map pocket, trunk, or glove compartment of a means of transportation.

A property owner, tenant, public or private employer, or business entity cannot enforce a policy that prohibits a person who can legally possess a firearm from lawfully transporting or storing any firearm that is both:

  * Provides alternative parking reasonably proximate to the primary parking area without charging an extra fee.

* * *

### Key State Laws

### Driver‚Äôs License Linked to Permit?

**Is my Arizona driver‚Äôs license linked to my Arizona concealed weapons permit?**

No. Your Arizona driver‚Äôs license is not linked to your Arizona concealed weapons permit. A law enforcement officer (LEO) will not be immediately notified that you are a concealed carry permit holder when they run your driver‚Äôs license. However, LEOs may have access to other databases where they can obtain this information.

### Preemption?

**Does Arizona have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e. does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?**

Yes. There is full state preemption of all gun laws. Section 13‚Äì3108 provides that if a court determines a political subdivision has knowingly violated the preemption law, the court may assess a civil penalty of up to $50,000. If a court determines that a state official enacting a law or rule knowingly violated the preemption law, that person‚Äôs term may be subject to termination.

### Red Flag Law?

**Does Arizona have a red flag law?**

No. Arizona does not have a red flag law.

### Public Access to Concealed Carry Registry?

**Does Arizona allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?**

No, the information is available only to criminal justice agencies.

### Carry While Consuming Alcohol?

**Does Arizona have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while consuming alcohol?**

No consumption allowed. As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

### ‚ÄúNo Weapons Allowed‚Äù Signs Enforced?

**Are ‚ÄúNo Weapons Allowed‚Äù signs enforced in Arizona?**

Yes. A person commits misconduct involving weapons by knowingly entering any public establishment or attending any public event carrying a deadly weapon after a reasonable request by the operator or sponsor to remove the weapon and place it in secure storage. Misconduct involving weapons is a class 1 misdemeanor. Additionally, Arizona law permits private business owners to prohibit weapons from being brought onto their property, whether signs are posted or not. Failure to obey the request can result in arrest for trespassing.

### Duty to Inform Officer You‚Äôre Carrying?

**Do you have a duty to notify a police officer that you‚Äôre carrying a concealed firearm in Arizona?**

No. You have no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you are carrying a concealed weapon unless the officer asks.

### Brandishing?

**Does Arizona state law define brandishing?**

No definition of brandishing was found in Arizona law. However, a person commits the crime of disorderly conduct if they recklessly handle, display, or discharge a deadly weapon. Defensive displays of a firearm without justification could also be charged as aggravated assault. Defensive displays include actions such as putting your hand on a firearm while it is concealed in a pocket, sweeping the jacket to expose the firearm, or saying you have a firearm without drawing or waving it. Arizona statutes specifically allow defensive displays and protect a citizen against being prosecuted for it when it is justified.

### Non-Resident Permitting?

**Does Arizona issue concealed carry permits to non-residents?**

Yes.
