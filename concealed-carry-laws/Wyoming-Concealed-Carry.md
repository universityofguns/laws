### Summary of Wyoming Gun Laws

Wyoming operates as a shall-issue state for concealed firearms permits (CFP). Applications are handled locally by county sheriffs and issued by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI). Local law enforcement exercises discretion in permit issuance.

### Firearm Purchase and Carry Laws

In Wyoming, no permit is required for purchasing firearms from private individuals, and there are no background checks or waiting periods. Firearms registration is not mandatory, except when buying handguns from Federal Firearms Dealers. Possession of a Wyoming CFP exempts holders from federal background check requirements.

Open carry is legal without a permit for individuals aged 18 and above who are legally entitled to possess firearms.

### Permitless Concealed Carry

Effective July 1, 2021, permitless concealed carry is permitted for U.S. legal residents aged 21 and older who can lawfully possess firearms. The minimum age for purchasing handguns is 21 years, and 18 years for shotguns or rifles. Certain locations, such as schools and establishments primarily serving alcohol, are restricted.

### Training Requirements and Reciprocity

A Wyoming CFP necessitates completion of a state-approved firearms training course or documented firearm experience (e.g., organized shooting competitions or military service). Wyoming does not issue non-resident permits but honors permits from states recognizing Wyoming permits.

### Self-Defense Laws

Wyoming adheres to Castle Doctrine principles and ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù laws, eliminating the duty to retreat. Individuals may use reasonable defensive force, including deadly force if necessary, to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. There is a presumption of reasonable fear when defending against intruders unlawfully entering homes or attempting forceful removal.

### Criminal Immunity

Individuals employing legal and reasonable defensive force are protected from criminal prosecution for such actions in Wyoming.
