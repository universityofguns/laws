### Summary of Delaware Gun Laws

Delaware operates under a may-issue system for concealed weapons licenses, issued at the county level by the prothonotary office. The Attorney General also has the authority to grant temporary concealed weapons licenses to non-residents based on specific employment-related security needs.

### Firearms Purchase and Registration

  * Delaware does not require a license for purchasing firearms nor is there a registration requirement. However, starting in November 2025, a permit will be required to purchase a firearm, as per a law signed on May 16, 2024.
  * Private-party transfers necessitate a background check by a licensed dealer, with exemptions for transfers to individuals possessing a valid Delaware Concealed Deadly Weapon License (CDWL).

### Open and Concealed Carry Laws

  * **Open Carry** : Legal for individuals over 21 who can legally possess a firearm, with restrictions in certain areas like schools and detention facilities.
  * **Concealed Carry** : Permissible for residents holding a CDWL and non-residents with a CCW permit from a state recognized by Delaware. Applicants must complete a firearms training course including live-fire exercises, provide five resident references, and publish their application in a local newspaper prior to submission.



### Use of Force in Self-Protection

  * The use of force is justified if necessary to protect against unlawful force, serious physical harm, kidnapping, or compelled sexual conduct.



### Civil Liability and Self-Defense

  * Individuals using force to protect property and not convicted of related offenses are shielded from civil liability.
  * Delaware follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing self-defense without a duty to retreat inside one‚Äôs dwelling or workplace but requiring retreat elsewhere unless safety is assured.



### Use of Force for Protection of Others and Property

  * Force can be used to protect others under circumstances where the defender would be justified in protecting themselves.
  * Deadly force is justifiable to prevent crimes like burglary, robbery, or arson, provided it is believed necessary to prevent serious harm.



[Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, ¬ß 464, 465 and 466]
