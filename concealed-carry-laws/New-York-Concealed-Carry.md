### Open Carry and Concealed Carry

Open carry is not explicitly addressed in New York state law. A New York Pistol License (NYPL) is required to possess a loaded handgun outside of the home or place of business. Concealed carry is legal only with a NYPL. The minimum age is 21, except for honorably discharged military members, who can apply at any age.

### Licensing Requirements

Residents, part-time residents, or individuals principally employed or conducting business in New York can obtain NYPLs. Pistol licenses issued by New York City are valid statewide, with the exception of the five counties within New York City where specific city validation is required.

### Restrictions and Reciprocity

New York does not recognize permits/licenses from any other states. Certain areas like schools and courthouses are off-limits for carrying handguns. Various types of NYPLs are available, with common ones including concealed carry and possess on premises licenses, which may have specific endorsements or restrictions.

### Self-Defense Laws

New York follows a self-defense law based on the Castle Doctrine. Individuals have a duty to retreat from attackers if they can safely do so. The use of physical force is permitted in self-defense, defense of others, and defense of property from crimes like larceny or criminal mischief.

### Use of Deadly Force

Deadly force is justifiable in New York when defending against imminent threats involving deadly physical force, kidnapping, forcible sexual acts, robbery, arson, or burglary, provided retreat is not safely possible.

### License Renewal and Recertification

Pistol or revolver licenses issued by New York City, Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk counties expire and require renewal every three years. Licenses issued outside these areas do not expire but must be recertified with the New York State Police every three years for concealed carry licenses.

### Carry Locations

### Carry in Vehicle?

**Question:** Can you carry a concealed handgun in a vehicle in New York?

**Answer:** Yes, based on the terms of a NYPL only. It is legal to transport a legal firearm through New York under Federal interstate transportation law 18 USC ¬ß 926A, provided the handgun is unloaded and neither the firearm nor any ammunition is readily accessible from the passenger compartment. In vehicles without a compartment separate from the driver‚Äôs compartment, the firearm or ammunition must be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console. If you do not have a NYPL and stop at a motel overnight, you are in violation of the law and subject to arrest if found with a firearm. Although a state license to carry a handgun is generally invalid in New York City, a license is valid if the firearm covered by the license:

  * Has been purchased from a licensed dealer within New York City and is being transported out of the city immediately from the dealer by the licensee in a locked container during a continuous and uninterrupted trip; or
  * Is being transported by the licensee in a locked container and the trip through New York City is continuous and uninterrupted.

### Key State Laws

### Duty to Inform Officer You‚Äôre Carrying?

Do you have a duty to inform a police officer that you‚Äôre carrying a concealed firearm in New York?

There is no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you‚Äôre carrying a concealed firearm in New York unless the officer asks. [N.Y. Pen. Law ¬ß 400.00(8)]

### Driver‚Äôs License Linked to Carry License?

Is my New York driver‚Äôs license linked to my New York carry license?

No. Your New York driver‚Äôs license is not linked to your New York pistol license. Therefore, a law enforcement officer will not be notified that you are a concealed carry license holder immediately when they run your driver‚Äôs license. However, law enforcement officers may have access to other databases where they can obtain this information.

### ‚ÄúNo Weapons Allowed‚Äù Signs Enforced?

Are ‚ÄúNo Weapons Allowed‚Äù signs enforced in New York?

No. However, on July 1, 2022, Gov. Hochul signed legislation that made ‚Äúno carry‚Äù the default for private property, unless deemed permissible by property owners. Property owners who decide to allow concealed carry will have to post signage indicating that concealed carry is allowed on the premises. According to Section 265.01-D, an individual is guilty of criminal possession if they enter or remain on private property where the owner or lessee does not have clear and conspicuous signage indicating that carrying firearms is permitted.

### Preemption?

Does New York have preemption laws related to concealed carry?

Yes. There is partial preemption primarily for handgun licensing. New York laws confer power upon local governments to adopt laws related to the protection, order, conduct, safety, health, and well-being of persons or property. However, local laws may not conflict with the state constitution or general laws. [N.Y. Pen. Law ¬ß 400.00(6)]

### Red Flag Law?

Does New York have a red flag law?

Yes. New York has a red flag law that allows police, district attorneys, family or household members, and school administrators or their designees to petition a court to have an order of protection issued to a person to remove their firearms, suspend any firearm license, and prevent them from purchasing, possessing, or attempting to purchase or possess a firearm, rifle, or shotgun. [N.Y. Civil Practice Law & Rules Article 63-A]

### Brandishing?

Does New York state law define brandishing?

No definition of brandishing was found in New York law. However, a person is guilty of menacing in the second degree when they intentionally place or attempt to place another person in reasonable fear of physical injury, serious physical injury, or death by displaying a deadly weapon, dangerous instrument, or what appears to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm. [N.Y. Penal Law ¬ß 120.14]

A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, they engage in fighting or in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior. [N.Y. Penal Law ¬ß 240.20]

### Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?

Does New York have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs?

Not addressed in state statutes. Regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

### Non-Resident Permitting?

Does New York issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?

Yes, for part-time New York State residents or anyone who is principally employed or has their principal place of business in the state.

### Public Access to Concealed Carry Registry?

Does New York allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?

Yes, although gun owners may request that their application information be exempt from public disclosure. However, local and state law enforcement shall have access to such database in the performance of their duties.

**Is there a waiting period after purchasing a handgun in New York?** Although there is no specific waiting period prior to the purchase of a firearm in New York, all handgun purchasers must obtain a NYPL or permit to possess, and such licenses/permits may take up to 6 months to process. In addition, Bill A02690, effective September 12, 2019, requires that firearm sales be suspended for a maximum of 30 days in cases where the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) issues a ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù result, allowing time for the background check to be completed.

### Minimum Age to Possess and Transport

**What is the minimum age to possess and transport a handgun in New York?** You must be 21 years old to possess or transport a handgun in New York state.

### Purchase Permits

**Is a permit required to purchase a handgun in New York?** Yes, a permit is required for handguns. A concealed carry license or a permit to possess a pistol or revolver is necessary to purchase a handgun. However, no permit is required for long guns.

### Background Checks for Private Gun Sales

**Are background checks required for private gun sales in New York? Are there exceptions?** Yes. For firearms transfers between private parties, a licensed dealer must conduct a background check, provide documentation of the check to the New York State Police, and keep a record of the transaction.

### New York License Exempts from Background Check

**Does my current New York concealed carry license exempt me from needing a background check when I purchase a firearm?** No.

### Handgun Registration

**Do handguns need to be registered in New York?** Yes, all handguns need to be registered. There is no registration for long guns. Handguns are identified on a person‚Äôs NY Pistol license by caliber, make, model, manufacturer‚Äôs name, and serial number. The license also indicates if the handgun may be carried on the person or possessed in a particular location. A license holder may apply at any time to their local licensing officer to amend their license to add newly purchased handguns or remove handguns they have sold.

### Handgun Purchase Process

**What is the process for purchasing a handgun in New York?** New York law requires that a NICS background check be completed by a licensed firearms dealer before the sale, exchange, or disposal of any firearm, unless the transaction is between members of an immediate family. Before taking possession of a firearm, you must supply the dealer with a purchase document obtained from the County Police Pistol License section. This document requires a bill of sale from the dealer, which includes the make, model, type, caliber, and serial number of the firearm, plus confirmation the purchaser has passed a NICS background check.

Upon completion of the background check by the licensed dealer, the dealer must finalize a document confirming the check was performed. All dealers must maintain transaction records on their premises and the records must be open at all reasonable hours for inspection by law enforcement. A dealer may charge a fee of up to $10.00 per transaction.

Purchase documents are valid for 20 days. The firearm must be presented to the state licensing unit within that period for inspection so it can be entered into the database.

### New York Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

### What is the process for pistol license recertification in New York?

Recertification is the responsibility of the licensee. The pistol license recertification provision of the SAFE Act, passed by the Legislature and signed into law by the Governor in 2013, aims to strengthen and improve the accuracy of record keeping at both the state and local levels. License holders were reminded of the January 31, 2018, deadline through letters, the press, and social media.

The State Police are working to process all recertifications and update their database, a process expected to take between 9‚Äì12 months. After this period, local licensing authorities will be provided with updated, accurate licensing information. The goal is compliance, so the State Police will not take criminal enforcement action against individuals who have unknowingly failed to recertify; instead, they will continue to accept recertifications throughout 2018.

If you have a New York City, Nassau County, Suffolk County, or Westchester County license, you must follow the requirements in place in your county, rather than using the New York State recertification system.

### How do I recertify my pistol license?

Recertification can only be done online. Paper forms are no longer accepted.

### What information do I need to provide during recertification?

Complete the form with your updated contact information.

### FAQ: New York Concealed Carry Questions

### What are the knife laws in New York?

It is legal to openly carry or conceal any legal knife provided there is no intent for unlawful use against another person. It is illegal to own a switchblade, pilum ballistic knife, metal knuckle knife, cane sword, and any knife adapted for use primarily as a weapon in New York. While it is legal for a U.S. citizen not previously convicted of any crime to own a gravity knife (as of May 30, 2019), dirk, dagger, dangerous knife, razor, or stiletto, it is illegal to carry them with the intent of unlawful use against another.

There are knife/weapon limitations and prohibitions for schools, school buses, court facilities, correctional facilities, and some airports. New York City has its own laws. A number of other municipalities, including Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse, also have restrictions.

The NY Metropolitan Transportation Authority rules prohibit any weapon, dangerous instrument, or any other item intended for use as a weapon from being carried in or on any facility or conveyance. A weapon or dangerous instrument includes, but is not limited to, a firearm, switchblade knife, gravity knife, box cutter, straight razor or razor blades that are not wrapped or enclosed in a protective covering, and a sword. Shotguns and rifles that are unloaded and carried in an enclosed case, box, or other container which completely conceals the item from view and identification as a weapon are allowed.

### Wear a COVID mask & carry?

There is no known statute in New York making it illegal to wear a COVID mask while carrying concealed.
