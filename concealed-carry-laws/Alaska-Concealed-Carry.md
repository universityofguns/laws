### Summary of Alaska Gun Laws

Alaska is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. There is no firearms registration, no permit required to purchase firearms, and no background check needed to buy a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry is legal in Alaska for any person who is legally allowed to possess a firearm. The minimum age to open carry is 21. Some areas are off-limits, including K-12 schools and any place where intoxicating liquor is sold for on-site consumption.

Concealed carry is legal for anyone at least 21 years of age or older who can legally possess a firearm ‚Äî a permit is not required. Residents who seek to be exempt from background checks when purchasing additional firearms or who want to carry a firearm in other states can obtain a concealed handgun permit to use in states with which Alaska has a reciprocity agreement. Concealed handgun permits are issued by the Alaska State Police and require a state-approved firearms training course. Alaska does not issue permits to non-residents. Since Alaska has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

### Use of Non-Deadly Force in Defense of Self

A person is justified in using non-deadly force when and to the extent the person reasonably believes it is necessary for self-defense against the use of unlawful force by another person, unless:

  * The person used the force in mutual combat not authorized by law;
  * The person claiming self-defense provoked the other‚Äôs conduct;

Alaska is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. A person has no duty to retreat before using deadly force in their temporary or permanent residence, property owned or leased, at their workplace, or when protecting a child or a member of the household.

  * Death;
  * Serious physical injury;
  * Kidnapping;
  * Sexual assault;
  * Sexual abuse of a minor; or
  * Robbery.



A person may not use deadly force if they know that, with complete personal safety and with complete safety for others being defended, they can avoid the necessity of using deadly force by leaving the area of the encounter, except there is no duty to retreat if the person is protecting a child or a member of their household, or is on premises that the person:

  * Owns or leases;
  * Resides in, temporarily or permanently;
  * Is employed to work; or
