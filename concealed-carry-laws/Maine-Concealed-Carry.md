A person may use non-deadly force to defend themselves or others from imminent unlawful non-deadly force. Deadly force is justifiable in cases of imminent deadly force, kidnapping, robbery, or sexual assault, provided the defender is not the aggressor.

### Use of Force in Defense of Premises

Property owners or those licensed to be on premises are justified in using non-deadly force to prevent criminal trespass and deadly force to prevent arson or in defense against intruders committing crimes inside their dwelling place.
