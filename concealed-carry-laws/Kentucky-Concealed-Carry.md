### Summary of Kentucky Gun Laws

Kentucky is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with licenses processed by the State Police.

No license is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, there is no waiting period, and there is no firearms registration in the state. A background check is required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer.

Open carry is legal in Kentucky without a license for anyone at least 18 years of age who is not prohibited from possessing a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including businesses primarily devoted to the sale of alcohol.

Kentucky is now a permitless carry state, so concealed carry is legal for anyone at least 21 years old who can legally possess a firearm without a license/permit. Those wanting to conceal carry out-of-state will still need to get a conceal carry license. Kentucky concealed carry licenses are referred to as Concealed Carry of Deadly Weapons (CCDW) licenses, and they apply to not only handguns but also knives, clubs, blackjacks, nunchaku, shuriken, and brass knuckles. Successful completion of a state-approved firearms training course is required to obtain a CCDW license. CCDW licenses are available to residents and military personnel stationed in Kentucky. Licenses are not available for non-residents. In terms of reciprocity, Kentucky recognizes all currently valid concealed carry permits issued by other U.S. jurisdictions.

### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Self or a Third Party

The use of physical force by a person is justifiable when the person believes that such force is necessary to protect themselves or a third party against the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force. The use of deadly force by a person is justifiable only when the person believes that such force is necessary to protect themselves or a third party against imminent death, serious physical injury, kidnapping, sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat, or another felony involving the use of force.

### Defense of Dwelling, Residence, or Occupied Vehicle

A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm when using deadly force to prevent or terminate another‚Äôs unlawful entry upon such person‚Äôs dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle, or an attempt to remove another against that person‚Äôs will from the dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle.

### Protection of Property

The use of physical force by a person is justifiable when the person believes that such force is immediately necessary to prevent:

  * The commission of criminal trespass, robbery, burglary, or other felony involving the use of force in a dwelling, building, or upon real property in his or her possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection one acts; or
  * Theft, criminal mischief, or any unlawful taking of tangible, movable property in his or her possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection one acts.



The use of deadly force by a defendant upon another person is justifiable only when the defendant believes that the person against whom such force is used is:

  * Attempting to dispossess him or her of the dwelling otherwise than under a claim of right to its possession;
  * Committing or attempting to commit a burglary, robbery, or other felony involving the use of force; or
  * Committing or attempting to commit arson of a dwelling or other building in his or her possession.

### Self-Defense

Kentucky is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where they have a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand their ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if they reasonably believe it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the commission of a felony involving the use of force.

### Justification and Criminal and Civil Immunity

A person who uses permitted force is justified in using such force and is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action, unless the person against whom the force was used is a peace officer.
