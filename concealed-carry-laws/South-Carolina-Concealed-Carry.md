### Summary of South Carolina Gun Laws

South Carolina operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state, where concealed weapons permits (CWPs) are issued by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED).

### Handgun Purchase Regulations

There is no requirement for a permit, background check, or firearms registration when purchasing a handgun from a private individual.

### Open and Concealed Carry Laws

As of March 7th, 2024, open carry and concealed carry without a permit are legal for individuals aged 18 or older, provided they are not prohibited by law. A ‚Äúconcealable weapon‚Äù can be openly carried or concealed on one‚Äôs person, except in areas where concealed carry is prohibited, such as private properties posted with ‚ÄòNo Concealable Weapons Allowed‚Äô signs.

### Concealed Weapons Permits (CWPs)

CWPs are issued to residents, non-residents who own property in South Carolina, and military personnel stationed in the state. Applicants must complete an 8-hour state-approved firearms training course. The minimum age requirement for a CWP is now 18 years old.

### Reciprocity

South Carolina recognizes resident permits from states that also recognize South Carolina permits, provided the reciprocal state requires a criminal background check and firearms training course for issuance.

### Off-Limits Areas

Certain locations are off-limits for concealed carry, including schools and courthouses.

### Self-Defense Laws

South Carolina follows the Castle Doctrine. Individuals attacked in a place where they have a right to be do not have a duty to retreat and may stand their ground. Deadly force is justified if there is a reasonable fear of imminent death, great bodily harm, or the commission of a violent crime against themselves or others in certain situations, including unlawful and forcible entries into dwellings, residences, or occupied vehicles.

  * **Dwelling:** A building or conveyance designed for people to lodge at night.
  * **Residence:** A dwelling where a person resides temporarily or permanently, including invited guests.
  * **Vehicle:** Any conveyance, motorized or not, designed for transporting people or property.
