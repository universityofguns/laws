### Summary of Montana Gun Laws

Montana is a shall-issue, permitless carry state, with concealed weapons permits processed locally by the county sheriff‚Äôs office.

No permit is required to purchase a firearm from a private individual, and there is no waiting period or firearms registration in the state. Background checks are not necessary for private sales but are required when purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer, except for Montana Concealed Weapons Permit holders.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Montana without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. The federal minimum age is 18, but state law allows 14-year-olds to carry or use a firearm in public under direct supervision of a parent, guardian, qualified firearms safety instructor, or an authorized adult. Some areas, such as federal buildings, are off-limits. Concealed carry is defined as carrying a handgun that is wholly or partially covered by clothing or apparel.

### Concealed Carry

Concealed carry is legal without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally own a firearm in most locations. A permit is required to carry concealed in portions of buildings used for state or local government offices and related restricted areas. HB-102, effective February 18, 2021, eliminated many prior gun-free zones in the state. Local municipalities can prohibit unpermitted concealed carry in publicly owned and occupied buildings. Montana does not issue permits to non-residents. Montana recognizes permits from states that require criminal records background checks.

### Use of Force in Defense of Occupied Structure

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another when they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or terminate unlawful entry into or attack upon an occupied structure. Deadly force is justified only if:

  * The entry is made or attempted, and the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent an assault upon themselves or another in the occupied structure; or
  * The person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony in the occupied structure.



### Use of Force in Defense of Person

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another when they reasonably believe it is necessary for self-defense or the defense of another against the other person‚Äôs imminent use of unlawful force. Deadly force is justified only if the person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

### Self-Defense

Montana follows the Castle Doctrine and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. A person who is lawfully in a place and threatened with bodily injury or loss of life has no duty to retreat or to summon law enforcement assistance before using force.

### Use of Force in Defense of Other Property

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another to prevent or terminate trespass on or criminal interference with real property (other than an occupied structure) or personal property lawfully in their possession or in the possession of an immediate family or household member, or a person whose property they have a legal duty to protect. Deadly force is justified only if the person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

‚ÄúForcible felony‚Äù refers to any felony involving the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.

[Montana Code Ann. ¬ß¬ß 45‚Äì3‚Äì102, 45‚Äì3‚Äì103, and 45‚Äì3‚Äì104]
