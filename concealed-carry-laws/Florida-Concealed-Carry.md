### Summary of Florida Gun Laws

**Permitless Carry and Licensing** Florida is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Concealed weapons licenses are issued at the state level by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).

No license, background check, or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual. Buyers must be at least 21 years old to purchase any firearm. Some counties have waiting periods for purchases from non-licensed sellers, but Florida Concealed Weapons License (CWL) holders are exempt.

**Open Carry Restrictions** Open carry is not legal in Florida, except for limited exceptions such as fishing, camping, lawful hunting, or target practice at an indoor range.

**Concealed Carry Regulations** Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Florida CWL and for non-residents with a CCW permit from a state that Florida honors. Permitless concealed carry is legal for anyone 21 years old or older who is not prohibited by law from carrying a firearm. The Florida CWL allows holders to carry not only a handgun but also other weapons such as electronic weapons, tear gas guns, billie clubs, and knives. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and have completed a firearms training course, or be a current member of the military or an honorably discharged veteran. CWLs are issued to residents and non-residents. Florida only honors resident CCW licenses from states with which it has a reciprocity agreement.

**New Legislation** On April 3, 2023, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed HB 543 into law, making Florida the 26th constitutional carry state in the U.S. This law took effect on July 1, 2023.

### Use of Force

**Non-Deadly Force** A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except deadly force, if they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or another against imminent unlawful force. There is no duty to retreat before using or threatening to use such force.

**Deadly Force** A person is justified in using deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent commission of a forcible felony or imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another. There is no duty to retreat and individuals have the right to stand their ground, provided they are not engaged in criminal activity and are in a place where they have a right to be.

Deadly force is also justified when resisting an attempt to murder or commit any felony upon oneself or in any dwelling where the person is located. The law presumes a reasonable fear of imminent death or bodily harm if an alleged perpetrator unlawfully enters or remains or attempts to remove another person against their will. Anyone who unlawfully and by force enters or attempts to enter another‚Äôs home or vehicle is presumed to have intent to commit an unlawful act involving force or violence.

### Self-Defense

Florida follows the Castle Doctrine. There is no duty to retreat if you are attacked in any place you have a lawful right to be. You may stand your ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if you reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to yourself or others.
