### Summary of Maryland Gun Laws

Maryland is now a shall-issue state following the Supreme Court’s ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen case on June 23rd, 2022. The issuance of concealed weapons permits is managed at the state level by the Secretary of the Maryland State Police.

### Handgun Purchase Requirements

To buy a handgun from a private individual in Maryland, a permit to purchase, background check, and firearms registration are mandatory. Private firearms sellers must conduct transfers through a licensed dealer or designated law enforcement agency, which then performs a background check. Maryland also maintains a handgun roster that limits the sale of handguns to those listed, with some exceptions.

### Concealed Carry Regulations

Concealed carry in Maryland is permitted only for holders of Maryland Wear/Carry Handgun Permits (WCHP). Open carry was prohibited as of October 1, 2023. Applicants for a WCHP must be at least 21 years old (or 18 years old for employment purposes only) and must complete a state-approved 16-hour firearms training course including live-fire training. Additional training is required at each renewal of the WCHP.

### Restrictions and Reciprocity

Maryland restricts carry in certain areas such as rest areas and state parks. The state does not recognize permits from other states (reciprocity).

### Self-Defense Laws

Maryland adheres to common law principles resembling Castle Doctrine principles. There is a duty to retreat, meaning individuals must attempt to retreat or avoid danger before resorting to deadly force in self-defense. Deadly force is justified only when faced with immediate danger of serious injury or death, provided certain conditions are met, including reasonable belief of imminent danger and non-provocation.

Under Maryland Code, individuals are protected from liability for personal injury or death of an intruder in their dwelling or place of business if they reasonably believe force or deadly force is necessary to repel an attack and if the force used is deemed reasonable under the circumstances.
