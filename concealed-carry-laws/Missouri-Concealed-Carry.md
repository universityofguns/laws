### Summary of Missouri Gun Laws

Missouri operates as a permitless carry state and a shall-issue state. Permits are issued at the county level for reciprocity purposes by sheriffs.

There is no requirement for a permit, background check, or firearms registration when purchasing a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal for individuals 19 years or older who can legally possess a firearm (18 for military members or honorably discharged). Local authorities may restrict concealed carry in buildings they own, lease, or control, and may require a Concealed Carry Permit (CCP) for open carry. The law in Missouri does not explicitly state that a permit is unnecessary for carry; instead, the definition of ‚Äúunlawful use of a weapon‚Äù specifies carrying in off-limits areas.

### Obtaining a Missouri Concealed Carry Permit (CCP)

To obtain a Missouri CCP, applicants must be at least 19 years old (18 for military members or honorably discharged) and have completed a firearms training course. Applications must be submitted in the applicant‚Äôs county of residence. Non-resident permits are available to active duty military personnel or veterans aged 18 or older stationed in Missouri. Restricted locations include courthouses, public passenger buses, and trains.

### Self-Defense Laws in Missouri

Missouri follows Castle Doctrine principles and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. This law allows individuals to defend themselves outside their homes without retreating. Deadly force is justifiable if a person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent death, serious physical injury, or a forcible felony. Physical force is justifiable to defend against unlawful force or to prevent theft, damage, or tampering with property.

In 2016, the Missouri Court of Appeals clarified that deadly force under the Castle Doctrine can only be used to protect against the use or imminent use of unlawful force, not solely to protect property.

Missouri law prohibits political subdivisions from restricting the use of firearms to defend people or property.
