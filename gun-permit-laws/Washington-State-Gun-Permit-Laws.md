Washington‚Äôs gun laws have evolved significantly, demonstrating the state‚Äôs proactive approach to firearm regulation and community safety. These changes highlight Washington‚Äôs commitment to responsible firearm ownership. As the state continues to refine its laws, informed discussions among stakeholders, policymakers, and the public are essential to balance individual rights with community security.

Under Washington firearm laws, no specific firearm license is required to purchase or possess a firearm. However, specific regulations apply:

  * **Handgun Purchases** : An application process is required for handgun purchases, including personal details and a statement of eligibility. A five-day waiting period applies for handgun delivery.
  * **Non-Residents** : Non-residents may face a longer waiting period of up to 60 days if they have not been Washington residents for at least three months.
  * **Firearm Possession** : There is no formal registration requirement, but police records are maintained for all firearm purchases.
  * **Age Requirements** : The minimum age for legal firearm possession is 18 years. Minors under 18 can possess shotguns or rifles with a valid hunter‚Äôs license or safety certificate.
  * **Felony Convictions** : Individuals with felony charges or who are not U.S. citizens (without appropriate permits) are prohibited from firearm possession.
  * **Concealed Carry** : A concealed handgun permit is required, except within one‚Äôs residence or place of business. Applicants must be 21 years old and meet eligibility criteria, including background checks and fingerprinting.
  * **Facility Restrictions** : It is illegal to carry concealed weapons in government facilities, schools, airports, or other prohibited locations.
