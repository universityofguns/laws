### Wyoming Gun Control Laws

Wyoming‚Äôs approach to gun control laws is characterized by minimal restrictions on gun ownership and purchase, distinguishing it from states with more stringent regulations. Here‚Äôs an overview of Wyoming‚Äôs gun laws and regulations:

### Overview

Wyoming does not mandate a license, permit, or registration for the purchase or ownership of firearms. The minimum age to purchase a long gun is 18, and for a handgun, it‚Äôs 21. The state implemented a permitless carry law in 2011, allowing eligible residents to carry concealed firearms without a permit. In 2021, this law was expanded to include qualified non-residents. However, Wyoming offers a concealed firearms permit (CFP) for residents seeking reciprocity in other states.

### Concealed Carry Permits

Residents can obtain a concealed carry permit from the Wyoming Attorney General‚Äôs office upon meeting eligibility criteria, including residency, age, and passing a background check conducted by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI). Wyoming operates as a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, meaning permits are issued if all objective criteria are met. Permits are valid for five years and facilitate exemption from background checks for new firearm purchases from federally licensed dealers.

### Prohibited Locations and Exceptions

Wyoming law prohibits carrying firearms in certain locations, such as law enforcement facilities, courtrooms (except as permitted by the judge), and places where alcohol is sold for on-premises consumption. Firearms are also restricted in school facilities unless authorized by security personnel or for specific educational purposes.

### Additional Regulations

Wyoming does not regulate assault weapons or ghost guns (firearms assembled from kits or 3D printed). There is no mandatory waiting period for firearm purchases, and state preemption laws prevent local authorities from enacting stricter gun regulations than those at the state level.
