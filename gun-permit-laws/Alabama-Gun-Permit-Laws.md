### Historical Context

Alabama has a deep-rooted tradition of gun ownership, aligned with the Second Amendmentâ€™s right to bear arms. Historically, the state had minimal requirements for firearm registration and licensing, with loose enforcement.

### Recent Legislative Changes

In response to concerns over gun-related crimes and fatalities, Alabama has implemented several noteworthy changes:

### Permitless Carry Law

Signed into law in May 2021, this allows individuals aged 21 and over to carry concealed handguns without a permit or training. It also permits carrying firearms in vehicles without a license, which supporters argue enhances personal freedom while critics fear potential safety risks.

### Stricter Gun Dealer Regulations

Previously lax regulations on gun dealers have been tightened. Dealers must now maintain sales records and undergo thorough background checks, aimed at curbing illegal gun sales and enhancing accountability.

### Red Flag Law

Introduced in 2019, this law enables family members or law enforcement to petition for temporary firearm confiscation from individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others. It provides a legal mechanism to prevent gun violence during mental health crises.

### Enhanced Concealed Carry Permits

Alabama has strengthened its concealed carry permit process, now requiring firearms training, stringent background checks, and sometimes mental health evaluations. This ensures that permit holders are well-prepared and responsible.
