### California‚Äôs Gun Control Laws

California has some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the United States, including a 10-day waiting period for firearm purchases and bans on assault weapons and firearms often associated with mass shootings.

The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence rates California‚Äôs gun safety laws highly, giving them an ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating. Lawmakers face the challenge of balancing gun violence prevention with gun owners‚Äô rights, particularly following recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the Second Amendment.

### Federal Firearms Law

While states handle most day-to-day firearm regulations, federal laws apply nationwide. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), part of the U.S. Department of Justice, oversees federal firearms licenses and investigates license holders. Federal laws restrict possession of certain dangerous weapons and prohibit ownership by specific individuals, such as convicted felons.

### California Gun Control Laws

California‚Äôs comprehensive gun laws aim to prevent illegal firearm use and possession. Initiatives like the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, established by Attorney General Rob Bonta, focus on reducing gun-related injuries and deaths.

### Regulations on Gun Purchases and Sales

California requires firearm buyers to obtain a Firearm Safety Certificate (FSC) by passing a written exam and being at least 18 years old. Concealed carry license holders and law enforcement officers are exempt.

Only licensed dealers may sell firearms, and buyers must provide personal information for the Dealers‚Äô Record of Sale (DROS), which is retained by the California DOJ. There is a mandatory 10-day waiting period for background checks, extendable to 30 days if needed.

Buyers must perform a safe-handling demonstration in the presence of a certified instructor before taking possession of a firearm. Gun shows must adhere to strict regulations, including background checks for purchasers.

Certain individuals, such as convicted felons and those convicted of specific domestic violence offenses, are prohibited from owning firearms in California.

### Carrying Concealed Weapons License

California requires a permit for carrying a concealed handgun. Applicants must be 21 or older, a state resident, and not disqualified by state or federal law. They must also complete an approved firearms safety course.

Concealed carry permits come with restrictions on carrying firearms in public places, including many sensitive locations like schools and airports. Recent legislation aims to expand these restrictions, though legal challenges have delayed implementation.

An entertainment firearms permit is available for filmmaking purposes, allowing certain regulations to be waived for up to one year.

### Assault Weapons and Magazine Capacity Restrictions

California bans several dangerous weapons, including assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, with limited exceptions for military and law enforcement personnel.

### Safe Storage and Motor Vehicle Regulations

Laws on safe firearm storage are designed to prevent access by children and prohibited individuals. Criminal penalties apply if a negligently stored firearm is accessed by a child or prohibited person, especially if it results in harm.

Firearms must be transported in a motor vehicle while unloaded and in a locked container or the trunk. Long guns must also be unloaded.

### Overview of California Gun Control Laws

California‚Äôs gun laws are among the strictest in the country. Understanding these regulations is crucial to avoid potential felony charges for violations.
