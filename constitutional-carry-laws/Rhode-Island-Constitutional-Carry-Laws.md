### New Gun Control Laws in Rhode Island

In 2022, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed three new gun control laws, all signed into law by Governor Dan McKee. These include:

  * Prohibition on large capacity feeding devices holding over 10 rounds of ammunition.
  * Ban on open carry of loaded shotguns and rifles on public roadways.
  * Increase in the minimum age for firearm purchases from 18 to 21 years.



Rhode Island‚Äôs firearm laws are among the stricter ones in the country. Legislators aim to balance reducing gun violence with respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners, a complex task in a nation with diverse views on gun regulation.

### Federal Firearms Oversight

Federal oversight of firearms is limited, managed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). This includes licensing for interstate firearms commerce and enforcing bans on possession by prohibited individuals. Federal law mandates background checks for firearm purchases by licensed dealers, supported by the FBI to prevent sales to felons and others barred from ownership.

### State-Level Gun Control Regulations

Most gun control regulations are set at the state level, covering issues like concealed carry permits, waiting periods for gun purchases, and restrictions on firearm possession in public places and vehicles. The Second Amendment guarantees individuals‚Äô rights to bear arms for self-defense, a principle broadened in recent U.S. Supreme Court interpretations, such as in the case of New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022). This ruling set stricter criteria for government regulations affecting gun rights.

### Rhode Island Gun Control Laws Overview

To purchase a handgun in Rhode Island, individuals must obtain a safety certificate from the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) following a firearms safety course. This requirement excludes law enforcement, military personnel, and active-duty military.

Rhode Island issues licenses to carry handguns publicly, either concealed or openly. Licensing authorities include local governments for concealed carry and the State Attorney General for both open and concealed carry, adhering to the ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù standard mandated by recent legal precedents. Unauthorized possession of a firearm can lead to felony charges, with exceptions for those carrying firearms legally licensed in other states while passing through Rhode Island.

Rhode Island mandates universal background checks for all private firearm sales and transfers. A seven-day waiting period is required between application and firearm delivery. The state‚Äôs laws do not include an assault weapons ban but prohibit certain firearms and restrict local governments from enacting conflicting gun regulations.
