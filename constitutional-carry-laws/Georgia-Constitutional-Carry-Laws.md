### Places Off-Limits Even With a Permit/License

#### Lawful Weapons Carrier Definition

A ‚ÄúLawful Weapons Carrier‚Äù includes anyone licensed under Code Section 16‚Äì11‚Äì129, eligible for a license, residents from other states who meet the eligibility requirements (excluding residency), and those licensed in other states.

### Carrying Weapons; License Requirements

#### Authorized Locations

Lawful carriers may carry weapons in parks, historic sites, recreational areas, wildlife management areas, and on public transportation, except where prohibited by federal law.

#### Unauthorized Locations

Carrying a weapon or long gun is prohibited in the following locations:

  * Government buildings without being a lawful carrier
  * Courthouses
  * Jails or prisons
  * Places of worship unless permitted
  * State mental health facilities for involuntary treatment
  * Nuclear power facilities
  * Within 150 feet of polling places during elections



### Exceptions

  * Legal proceedings with secured weapons as exhibits
  * Notification and compliance with security personnel directives upon arrival at prohibited locations
  * Weapons in a motor vehicle‚Äôs locked compartment or firearms rack



#### Government Buildings

Lawful carriers may carry in government buildings when open and not restricted by security. Failure to clear security must result in immediate exit to avoid misdemeanor charges. Non-lawful carriers attempting entry with a weapon face misdemeanor charges.

#### Places of Worship

Violations by lawful carriers in places of worship result in a fine up to $100. Non-lawful carriers face misdemeanor charges.

### General Provisions

This section does not affect exemptions provided under Code Section 16‚Äì11‚Äì130.

### Do ‚ÄúNo Gun‚Äù Signs Have the Force of Law?

### No

In Georgia, ‚ÄúNo Firearm‚Äù signs do not have the force of law unless posted on property explicitly mentioned in state law as off-limits for those with a permit or license to carry. If you are asked to leave a location not specified in the law, you must comply. Refusal to leave can result in legal charges. Always be cautious, as responding police officers may not be familiar with specific trespass laws and could arrest you, even if you are within your rights.

#### Recommendation

It is advisable not to enter establishments with ‚ÄúNo Firearms‚Äù signs, regardless of state laws regarding signage. Consider giving a ‚ÄúNo Guns = No Money‚Äù card to the owner of such establishments. Respecting property owners‚Äô rights, even when disagreeing, is an important aspect of responsible gun ownership and upholding the Second Amendment.

### Parking Lot Storage Law

### Overview

Georgia law prohibits private or public employers, including the state and its subdivisions, from enforcing policies that allow searching locked, privately owned vehicles of employees or guests on employer parking lots.

### Employment Conditions

Employers cannot require prospective employees to agree not to have firearms or ammunition in their locked vehicles on the employer‚Äôs parking lot, provided the employee is a lawful weapons carrier.

### Exceptions

  * Searches by law enforcement with valid warrants or based on probable cause under exigent circumstances
  * Vehicles owned or leased by the employer
  * Situations where accessing a vehicle is necessary to prevent immediate threats to health, life, or safety
  * Searches consented to by employees for loss prevention based on probable cause



### Special Cases

Certain locations and situations are exempt from these provisions, including secure parking areas, penal institutions, utility facilities, and areas with federal restrictions.

### Liability

Employers are not liable for incidents involving firearms stored in vehicles unless they commit a criminal act or knew someone would use a firearm criminally on their premises. There is no new duty imposed on employers regarding employee at-will status.

### Legal Actions

Employers complying with safety laws have a complete defense in related actions. Plaintiffs in lawsuits about workplace firearm use may be liable for legal costs if the employer prevails.

### Property Rights

The rights of property owners or those in control of property through leases or agreements are maintained, particularly if they are also employers.

### RV/Car Carry Without a Permit/License

### Overview

Under Georgia law, individuals who are not prohibited from possessing firearms can carry a long gun on their property or inside their home, motor vehicle, or place of business.

#### Carrying in Vehicles

Individuals not prohibited by law may carry a long gun in their vehicle. Lawful weapons carriers can transport handguns or long guns in private vehicles. However, private property owners can exclude or eject individuals carrying weapons on their property, subject to certain conditions.

### Reciprocity and Recognition

Individuals licensed to carry in states that recognize Georgia permits may carry in Georgia, provided they comply with state laws. Licenses are not recognized for individuals under 21. The Attorney General maintains a list of states that recognize Georgia licenses.

### Specific Locations

Lawful weapons carriers may carry firearms in parks, historic sites, recreational areas, wildlife management areas, and on public transportation, except where prohibited by federal law.

#### Note

No permit is required to carry a firearm inside your own vehicle, either openly or concealed. However, carrying in someone else‚Äôs vehicle requires the owner‚Äôs permission.

### State Preemption

### Legislative Findings

The regulation of firearms and other weapons is considered a state-wide concern. The General Assembly states that the lawful design, marketing, manufacture, and sale of firearms and ammunition are not inherently dangerous and do not constitute a nuisance.

### Preemption of Local Regulation

No county or municipal corporation, nor any state agency, board, department, commission, or authority, may regulate:

  * Gun shows
  * Possession, ownership, transport, carrying, transfer, sale, purchase, licensing, or registration of firearms or other weapons
  * Firearms dealers or dealers of other weapons
  * Dealers in components of firearms or other weapons



Only the state has the authority to bring lawsuits against firearms or ammunition manufacturers, trade associations, or dealers for issues related to their lawful design, manufacture, marketing, or sale.

### Local Regulations

Local governments may regulate the transport, carrying, or possession of firearms by their employees or volunteers during their official duties, provided these regulations align with state and federal laws. Sheriffs, chiefs of police, and commanding officers of law enforcement agencies have specific authority over their personnel regarding firearms regulations.

### Municipal and County Ordinances

Municipalities or counties may require the ownership of guns by heads of households. Municipalities or counties may limit or prohibit the discharge of firearms within their boundaries.

### Definition of Weapon

The term ‚Äúweapon‚Äù includes any device intended for offense or defense, such as firearms, bladed devices, clubs, electric stun devices, and defense sprays.

### Legal Recourse

Individuals aggrieved by violations of this section may bring an action for damages, including actual damages or $100, equitable relief, attorney‚Äôs fees, and other appropriate relief.

### Emergency Powers of Governor

### Declaration and Duration of Emergency

The Governor can declare a state of emergency or disaster due to natural or human-caused events, pandemics, or public health emergencies. A special session of the General Assembly is required for public health emergencies, convening two days after such a declaration. The state of emergency continues until the Governor determines the threat has passed or conditions have improved. It cannot exceed 30 days without renewal, and the General Assembly can terminate it anytime.
