### Arizona Gun Control Laws

Arizona gun control laws are among the least restrictive in the United States. In 2010, Arizona was one of the first states to enact a permitless or constitutional carry law. As a result, Arizona allows any person 21 years or older who is not a prohibited possessor to carry a firearm openly or concealed without the need for a concealed weapons permit.

Arizona, like other states, has struggled to prevent mass shootings and gun violence. In 2011, an armed man appeared at a public event at a Tucson area Safeway store parking lot. He shot Gabrielle Giffords, a member of Congress who represented Arizona‚Äôs 8th Congressional District, along with 18 others. Six of the victims, including a federal court judge, died from their injuries. Giffords recovered from a gunshot wound to her head after surgery and months of therapy. She later left Congress and founded the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Although lawmakers spoke out against the assassination attempt and loss of life, it did not lead to changes in Arizona gun laws.

### Federal Firearms Law

Both federal and state laws address the possession, carrying, and use of firearms. Federal law regulates the ownership and use of certain dangerous weapons, including machine guns and devices like bump stocks, which cause a semi-automatic rifle to fire like a fully automatic weapon. The federal government also licenses firearms dealers and bans the possession of firearms by certain persons like convicted felons and those using illegal drugs. Efforts by both the federal and state governments to regulate firearms must comply with the Second Amendment rights of gun owners to bear arms for lawful purposes such as self-defense.

In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court held gun laws that burden the right to bear arms must be consistent with the nation‚Äôs historical tradition of firearm regulation. Gun rights advocates have filed new challenges to many federal and state gun regulations, citing the new historical test from Bruen.

### Arizona Gun Laws

In Arizona, the state constitution also protects the right to bear arms. Firearm laws continue to reflect the state‚Äôs permissive approach to gun regulation. Arizona does not ban assault weapons. The state has no waiting period or licensing process for the purchase of a firearm. It does not require private gun sales or transfers to include a criminal background check.

### Concealed Carry Laws

States like Arizona that have permitless handgun carry laws operate on the honor system. They presume that citizens know when the law prohibits them from having a firearm and will comply. Such laws have replaced prior concealed carry permit laws that required a person to pass a criminal background check and complete a firearms safety training course before they received permission to carry a concealed firearm.

Even though Arizona is a permitless carry state, it maintains its concealed carry weapons (CCW) permit process for purposes of reciprocity with other states. For that reason, many individuals still seek the issuance of CCW permits. The Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) accepts applications for such permits. Arizona is a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, which means that the DPS must issue a permit to individuals who meet the objective criteria outlined in the statute. You can apply online or by mailing the application packet to the DPS in Phoenix.

### Location Restrictions

Arizona law prohibits taking firearms into the following locations:

  * Polling places on election day
  * School grounds
  * Commercial nuclear hydroelectric generating stations
  * Military installations
  * Correctional facilities
  * Game preserves
  * National parks
  * Federal buildings
  * Airports (secure locations)
  * Where federal, state, or local laws prohibit weapons
  * On private property or in businesses where the owner or establishment has posted signs prohibiting weapons or asked you to remove them
  * At a public establishment or public event after a reasonable request by the operator to remove the weapon and place it in temporary storage



There are often exceptions for peace officers and others authorized by the owner or business. To know if you may qualify for an exception, check the website or call an official in advance for clarification.

  * Automatic weapons (firearm capable of shooting one or more shots automatically without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger)
  * Rifles with barrels less than 16 inches
