### Right to Keep and Bear Arms in the United States

In the United States, individuals have the constitutional right to keep and bear arms for self-defense, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and supported by legal interpretations. Many states, including Utah, also affirm this right in their own constitutions.

### Federal Firearms Law

Federal firearms law, derived from the authority to regulate interstate commerce, applies uniformly across all states. It permits the legal manufacture, sale, and possession of firearms while requiring registration for certain types like machine guns and short-barreled weapons. Federal law also prohibits firearm possession by individuals posing risks to public safety, such as felons and those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. Transactions through licensed dealers necessitate FBI background checks to prevent firearms from reaching unauthorized individuals.

### Utah Gun Laws Overview

Utah’s firearm laws reflect its stance on public safety and the rights of gun owners, often imposing fewer restrictions compared to other states. Notably, Utah passed a law in 2021 allowing “permitless carry,” enabling law-abiding adults to carry concealed handguns in public without permits, provided they meet age and eligibility requirements.
