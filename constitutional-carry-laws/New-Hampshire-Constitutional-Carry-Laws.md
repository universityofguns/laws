### Gun Control Landscape in the United States

Gun control remains a contentious issue in the United States, balancing federal constitutional rights with concerns over public safety. Regulation primarily occurs through state and federal laws, often leaving states to take the lead due to federal legislative challenges.

### Impact of U.S. Supreme Court Decisions

Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have significantly influenced gun rights. In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court affirmed the Second Amendment right for individuals to possess firearms for self-defense, overturning stringent D.C. handgun ownership restrictions.

In New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), the Court ruled against strict ‚Äúmay issue‚Äù concealed carry permit policies, reinforcing the right to carry firearms for self-defense in public.

### State Responses and Legislative Trends

In response to these rulings, several states have adopted ‚Äúpermitless carry‚Äù or ‚Äúconstitutional carry‚Äù laws. New Hampshire, for instance, implemented such legislation in 2017, emphasizing the right to self-defense without requiring government-issued permits.

### Federal Firearms Regulation

Federal firearm regulation is more limited compared to state authority. The National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 provide frameworks for taxing and regulating firearms and prohibit certain categories of individuals from owning them. Federal law mandates background checks for purchases from licensed dealers but exempts private sales.
