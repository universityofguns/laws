### Colorado Gun Control Overview

Recent measures by the Colorado legislature are seen by gun control advocates as steps to reduce gun violence and enhance public safety. The nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety ranks Colorado eleventh in the U.S. for its gun laws. Colorado has recently enacted laws that increase the minimum age to purchase a handgun to 21, implement a three-day waiting period for background checks after firearm purchases, and impose restrictions on ghost guns.

Understanding Colorado‚Äôs gun laws can be challenging due to the mix of state and federal statutes. Gun owners must navigate these laws to comprehend their rights and ensure compliance. New prohibitions and regulations often face legal challenges; for instance, all three laws passed in 2023 are currently contested by gun rights advocates.

In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual‚Äôs right to own guns for self-defense at home. In 2022, in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Court affirmed the right to carry guns in public for self-defense. This means gun control legislation is heavily scrutinized by lawmakers and courts.

Colorado gun owners must also comply with federal laws governing the purchase, sale, possession, and use of firearms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 sets the framework for firearm regulation, including a list of prohibited persons. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994 expanded this list and established a federal background check system to prevent sales to felons and other prohibited individuals.

Even with Second Amendment protections, states can regulate certain weapons and accessories. In Colorado, sawed-off shotguns and silencers are illegal.

Colorado does not ban assault weapons but limits large-capacity magazines. The Colorado Supreme Court upheld this limitation in Rocky Mountain Gun Owners v. Polis (2020), ruling that it did not unduly infringe on gun rights under the state constitution.

Background checks are nearly universal in Colorado, required for all sales or transfers through firearms dealers, including private sales. Certain temporary transfers, gifts, and loans between family members are exempt. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation provides guidance on background checks and firearm prohibitions.

In 2021, Colorado revised state law to allow local jurisdictions like Denver and Boulder County to enact stricter gun control measures, such as restrictions on open carry and concealed carry, and bans on assault weapons.

In 2022, Governor Jared Polis signed the Vote Without Fear Act, prohibiting open carry within 100 feet of polling places during elections. In 2023, Colorado expanded its red flag law, enabling more individuals to request extreme risk protection orders to restrict access to firearms for those deemed a risk to themselves or others.
