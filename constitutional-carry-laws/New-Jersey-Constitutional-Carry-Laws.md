### Public Safety Concerns and Constitutional Rights

Discussions on gun control often revolve around concerns over gun violence. Statistics show that a significant portion of gun deaths in the U.S. are due to suicides (54%) and homicides (43%), highlighting the diverse public safety issues associated with firearms.

### Impact of Recent Legal Developments

Recent legal developments, including the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, have reshaped gun rights litigation. This decision invalidated restrictive state concealed carry permit systems, establishing new standards for evaluating state regulations that may infringe on Second Amendment rights.

### Federal Firearms Regulations

Federal laws governing firearms primarily date back to the 20th century, covering manufacturing, sale, ownership, and possession. Certain firearms, like machine guns, require strict federal registration and oversight. Federal law prohibits firearm ownership for felons, individuals with specific mental health histories, and those convicted of drug offenses.

### New Jersey’s Stringent Gun Laws

New Jersey has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, enacted under Governor Phil Murphy’s administration. These include bans on assault firearms and ghost guns, rigorous requirements for handgun purchase permits, and mandatory background checks for private firearms transactions through licensed dealers.

### Detailed Regulations in New Jersey

To purchase a handgun in New Jersey, individuals must obtain a handgun purchase permit and undergo a 7-day waiting period. A Firearms Purchaser Identification Card (FPIC) is necessary for buying rifles or shotguns, with limits on the number of handguns purchasable within a 30-day period.

Recent legislative updates have overhauled New Jersey’s concealed carry permit process, transitioning from a discretionary “justifiable need” standard to stricter requirements, including background checks, endorsements, firearms training, and liability insurance.
