### Gun Control in North Carolina

The topic of gun control remains contentious, whether at the state legislature or in Congress. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and provisions in most state constitutions protect citizensâ€™ rights to own and bear arms. Gun violence challenges both state and federal governments to find effective ways to ensure public safety.

North Carolinaâ€™s gun control laws aim to balance the rights of gun owners with the stateâ€™s obligation to protect its residents. To some observers, North Carolinaâ€™s laws are perceived as permissive. The state does not impose regulations on or restrict access to assault weapons. In 2023, North Carolina repealed its pistol purchase permit law.

### Federal Firearms Law

While states largely regulate guns, several critical federal laws apply nationwide. Federal law governs the ownership and registration of certain firearms and accessories such as machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, sawed-off rifles, and silencers. It also mandates licensing requirements for firearms dealers.

Federal law prohibits gun possession by individuals convicted of felonies or misdemeanor domestic violence. These federal restrictions underpin the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), used by federally licensed firearms dealers and most law enforcement agencies to prevent firearms from reaching prohibited individuals.

### North Carolina Gun Control Laws

State laws often go beyond federal laws in regulating firearms. They can restrict the sale, purchase, use, and carrying of guns based on state-specific political and ideological beliefs. While all states have some gun restrictions, North Carolinaâ€™s laws are considered less restrictive compared to many others.

### Background Checks on Gun Purchases

There has been national momentum to implement universal background checks for gun purchases in several states. Anyone purchasing a firearm through a federally licensed dealer must pass a background check before taking possession. However, federal law does not cover private sales and transfers of firearms.

North Carolina had previously closed the background check loophole for handgun purchases with a requirement to obtain a permit. Despite national support for universal background checks, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation to repeal the stateâ€™s pistol purchase permit law, overriding Governor Roy Cooperâ€™s veto.

### License and Carry Laws

In general, North Carolina law prohibits the concealed carry of firearms, with exceptions for active-duty military personnel, certain law enforcement officers, and government officials.

North Carolina issues concealed carry permits (CHP) for those wishing to carry a concealed handgun in public. Applicants must apply at their local sheriffâ€™s office and undergo a criminal background check before receiving a permit. The North Carolina Sheriffsâ€™ Association provides guidance on the application process.

Whether or not you have a CHP, it is illegal to consume alcohol or be under the influence of drugs while carrying a firearm. Certain locations, such as schools, courthouses, and places where alcohol is sold and consumed, are off-limits for firearms.
