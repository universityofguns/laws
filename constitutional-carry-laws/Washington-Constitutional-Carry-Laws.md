### Federal Firearms Law

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) oversees federal gun licenses and enforces laws against illegal firearm trafficking. Federal regulations prohibit certain individuals, such as convicted felons, from owning firearms and established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

### Washington State Gun Control Laws

Washington State has implemented stringent firearms laws to enhance safety while respecting gun ownersâ€™ rights.

#### Regulation of Gun Purchases and Sales

Washington voters have enacted several laws through ballot initiatives:

  * **Universal Background Checks (2016):** Mandates background checks for private firearm sales via licensed dealers.
  * **Red Flag Law (2017):** Allows courts to issue extreme risk protection orders to prevent firearm access by individuals posing threats.
  * **Minimum Age Requirement (2018):** Raised the minimum age for purchasing handguns and semi-automatic rifles to 21.
  * **Waiting Period and Firearms Safety Training (2023):** Requires a waiting period and proof of firearms safety training for all purchases.



#### Concealed Carry License Requirements

To carry a concealed firearm in Washington, applicants must obtain a concealed pistol license (CPL) from local law enforcement, meeting age requirements, passing background checks, and other criteria.

### Location Restrictions for Firearms

Despite a CPL, carrying firearms is restricted in specific locations such as courtrooms, schools, and public facilities, including airports and libraries. Open carry is prohibited in these areas.

### Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines

Washington prohibits assault weapons, large-capacity magazines, and accessories like bump stocks, with exceptions for certain authorized entities. Possession of these items is restricted despite bans on their sale, manufacture, import, and distribution.

### Child Access and Vehicle Restrictions

Minors under 18 face restrictions on firearm possession, with exemptions for supervised hunting or firearms training. Only those 21 or older may purchase handguns or semi-automatic rifles. Improper firearm storage leading to unauthorized access carries penalties, and loaded pistols in vehicles are regulated unless carried with a CPL.

### Relevant Washington State Gun Laws

The Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Title 9, Chapter 9.41 covers definitions, unlawful possession, concealed pistol licenses, background checks, and restrictions on firearms.

#### Illegal Arms and Waiting Period

Possession of prohibited firearms like machine guns and undetectable firearms is illegal, with a mandatory 10-day waiting period after purchase for background checks.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

Applicants for a CPL must be 21 or older, free of legal restrictions on firearm possession, and pass background checks.

### Machine Gun Laws

Except for certain pre-existing exemptions, owning or possessing machine guns in compliance with federal law is illegal in Washington.
