### Kentucky Gun Control Laws

Kentucky‚Äôs gun control laws are less restrictive compared to many other states, reflecting the state‚Äôs commitment to upholding the Second Amendment right to bear arms. This stance is contrasted with states that have more stringent regulations, particularly in response to concerns about mass shootings.

### Constitutional and Federal Context

The right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which the Supreme Court has interpreted as an individual right to own firearms for self-defense, both at home and in public. Federal law sets a baseline for firearm regulations, including the legal manufacture, sale, possession, and use of firearms. It also identifies people banned from having firearms, such as felons and those addicted to illegal drugs. Licensed federal firearms dealers must perform background checks on potential buyers.

In cases where federal and state laws intersect, federal law generally takes precedence. Gun owners in Kentucky must comply with federal laws like the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the National Firearms Act. States may choose to enact stricter laws.

### Gun Control Laws in Kentucky

Kentucky regulates firearms but does not require permits to purchase them or limit certain assault-style weapons and accessories. The state does ban armor-piercing bullets and prohibits felons from owning firearms. Licensed dealers must conduct background checks, but private sales between unlicensed individuals do not require them.

In 2019, Kentucky adopted a ‚Äúpermitless carry‚Äù law, allowing individuals 21 or older and legally permitted to possess firearms to carry a concealed handgun without a state permit. Kentucky also maintains a process for obtaining a Concealed Deadly Weapon License (CDWL) for reciprocity purposes. A CDWL is available to Kentucky residents who are 21 or older. There is no minimum age or permit requirement for carrying shotguns or rifles.

To obtain a CDWL, applicants must apply at their local sheriff‚Äôs office, which forwards the application to the Kentucky State Police. Applicants must provide a certificate of completed firearms training. The State Police conduct a background investigation before issuing the license.

### Location Restrictions

Kentucky law restricts firearms in certain locations, including:

  * Police stations and sheriff‚Äôs offices
  * Detention facilities, prisons, and jails
  * Courthouses
  * Meetings of the General Assembly and its committees
  * Meetings of municipal, county, or special district governing bodies
  * Areas designated for the consumption of alcoholic beverages in licensed establishments
  * Elementary and secondary school facilities
  * Childcare facilities and daycare centers
  * Controlled areas of airports
  * Locations prohibited by federal law
  * Private businesses with clear notices prohibiting firearms



Local governments, colleges, universities, and state government units may also restrict concealed handguns on properties they control. Private property owners can ban firearms on their premises.

Kentucky has a preemption statute, meaning state law overrides local regulations in most firearms matters. For example, Louisville cannot enact an assault weapons ban if it conflicts with state law. Kentucky law also allows the carrying of firearms in motor vehicles. Firearms stored in any enclosed container, compartment, or storage space installed by the vehicle manufacturer are not considered concealed.
