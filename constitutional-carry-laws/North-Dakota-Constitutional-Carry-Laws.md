### Gun Control Laws in the United States

Gun control laws in the United States encompass a combination of federal and state regulations aimed at preventing gun violence. Federal law, rooted in the Second Amendmentâ€™s right to bear arms and the Gun Control Act of 1968, establishes a foundational framework. State laws then add varying degrees of restrictions or liberties.

Federal regulation of firearms began significantly with the National Firearms Act (NFA) in the 1930s, which imposed taxes on manufacturing specific firearms such as machine guns, short-barreled shotguns, and rifles with barrels under 18 inches, as well as silencers and mufflers, and required their registration.

The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) amended and expanded NFA provisions, broadening the list of prohibited persons who are barred from possessing or owning firearms. In the 1990s, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was established under federal law.

### North Dakotaâ€™s Gun Control Laws

North Dakotaâ€™s gun laws are relatively less restrictive compared to many other states. Unlike states that mandate a waiting period for gun purchases, North Dakota does not require one. Federal law mandates a criminal background check for firearms purchased from federally licensed dealers but does not extend to private sales not involving licensed dealers.

Some states require universal background checks for all firearms purchases or transfers, but North Dakota does not enforce such a requirement.

In 2017, North Dakota enacted Constitutional Carry legislation, allowing residents to carry concealed firearms without a concealed weapons license (CWL) if they are otherwise eligible under state and federal law. Individuals must carry a valid driverâ€™s license or state ID and cannot be prohibited from firearm possession.

There has been debate regarding the legality of carrying loaded firearms in vehicles under Constitutional Carry. The North Dakota Attorney General issued an opinion affirming that eligible individuals under Constitutional Carry can transport loaded firearms if they possess a valid state driverâ€™s license or ID upon law enforcement request, now incorporated into state law.
