### Overview of Indiana Gun Control Laws

Gun control laws in the United States are governed by both federal and state regulations, aimed at balancing individual rights with public safety concerns.

### Federal Regulations

Federal law, administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), regulates firearms through licensing requirements for dealers, restrictions on dangerous firearms, and background checks via the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

### Indiana Gun Laws

Indiana‚Äôs state gun laws are generally less restrictive compared to other states, with specific regulations governing the purchase, possession, and use of firearms.

#### Prohibited Firearms and Ammunition

Indiana prohibits certain weapons and ammunition types, including machine guns and armor-piercing bullets, with exceptions for military and law enforcement use. Notably, Indiana does not enforce bans on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, nor does it restrict ghost guns assembled from kits or 3D-printed.

#### Background Checks

Gun purchases through federally licensed dealers in Indiana require a criminal background check before transfer. Private sales, however, do not mandate such checks.

#### Permitless Carry Law

As of July 1, 2022, Indiana adopted a permitless carry law, allowing individuals aged 18 and older who are legally eligible to possess firearms to carry them openly or concealed without a permit.

#### Handgun Licenses

Residents and eligible non-residents may apply for a handgun license in Indiana through local law enforcement agencies. The state does not charge a fee for these licenses, although applicants must undergo a background check and provide fingerprints.

#### Restrictions on Carry

Despite its permissive carry laws, Indiana restricts firearms in specific locations, including schools, airports, state fairgrounds, casinos, jails, and certain government buildings. Private businesses and employers can also prohibit firearms on their premises.

#### Red Flag Law

Enacted in 2020, Indiana‚Äôs red flag law permits law enforcement to seize firearms from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others. The process involves court review and may result in temporary firearm confiscation pending a final hearing.

Indiana‚Äôs approach to gun control aims to balance individual rights with public safety, reflecting a blend of permissive carry laws with measures to restrict firearms in sensitive locations and mitigate risks posed by dangerous individuals.
