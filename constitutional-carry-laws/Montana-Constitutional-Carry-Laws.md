### Gun Control Laws in the U.S.: A Challenging Consensus

Finding consensus on gun control laws in Congress and state legislatures remains a major challenge in the U.S. On the one hand, the U.S. Constitution and most state constitutions protect citizens‚Äô right to bear arms. On the other, gun violence disrupts communities daily.

In 2023, the Gun Violence Archive reported 656 mass shootings in America, defining a mass shooting as an incident where four or more persons are killed or injured, not including the shooter.

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides a check on both state and federal gun laws. Recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court support an individual‚Äôs right to possess firearms for self-defense and other purposes. Still, the right to own guns is not absolute and remains subject to reasonable regulations consistent with U.S. history and tradition.

### Federal Firearms Regulations

The federal government provides limited regulations on firearms. These include mandated registration of certain dangerous weapons and a licensing framework for firearms dealers and manufacturers. Federal law identifies categories of persons who cannot possess firearms, such as convicted felons. Federal firearms dealers must refer each purchase for criminal background checks to help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.

More detailed regulations on who can purchase, sell, own, possess, and carry firearms fall under state law. As such, gun control laws vary from one state to another.

### Montana Gun Control Laws

A recent study concluded that Montana residents own the most guns per capita in the U.S. Despite being one of the largest states by land mass, Montana has just over one million residents. The estimate is that 65% of Montana‚Äôs households contain a gun, making Montana gun control laws some of the most permissive in the country. A Montana resident doesn‚Äôt need to get a gun license, register their guns, or get a permit to purchase or possess firearms.

Montana law does not require a waiting period on firearm purchases. The state does not ban assault weapons or high-capacity magazines. Montana provides no specific regulations on carrying firearms in motor vehicles. Its public safety efforts focus more on prohibiting possession by those with certain felony convictions and providing penalties for crimes involving the use of a firearm.

In 2021, Montana became a permitless carry state. This means that a person who can legally possess a firearm can also carry a concealed firearm in public without first passing a background check. Montana still offers a regular concealed carry permit and an enhanced concealed carry permit. Permit holders may qualify for reciprocity to carry under the firearms laws of other states. Having a state permit can also bypass a background check each time you purchase a new firearm.

To obtain a regular or enhanced Montana permit, complete an application with your local sheriff‚Äôs office. Montana is a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state for concealed handgun permits. If an applicant meets all the eligibility criteria and passes a background check, the county sheriff must issue the permit. Eligibility information is available on the Montana Department of Justice website.

The Montana Attorney General also provides a list of states whose permits are recognized by Montana. Nonresidents can carry concealed weapons if their state‚Äôs permit requires a background check before its issuance and they have both the permit and a photo ID on their person. Qualified law enforcement officers can also carry a concealed weapon without a permit.

While Montana allows both concealed and open carry of firearms in public, there are certain location restrictions. In most situations, you cannot possess or carry a firearm in these places:

  * School buildings as determined by the school board
  * Courtrooms and areas of a courthouse as determined by order of a judge or court
  * Portions of buildings used for state or local government offices that have been restricted (exception for state concealed weapon permit holders)
  * Secure treatment facilities of the Department of Health and Human Services
  * Correctional, detention, and treatment facilities operated by the Department of Corrections
  * Detention facilities or secure areas of a local law enforcement agency of a city or county
  * At or beyond the security screening checkpoint in a public, commercial airport
  * Federal buildings
  * Military reservations operated by the U.S.
  * Private property where the owner or person in control expressly prohibits firearms
  * Universities and college campuses as determined by the board of regents, as per the 2022 Montana Supreme Court case Board of Regents of High Education v. Knudsen
