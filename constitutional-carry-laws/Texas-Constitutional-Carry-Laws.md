### Texas Gun Laws Overview

Texas has some of the most permissive gun laws in the United States. While certain firearms and ammunition types like machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, silencers, armor-piercing bullets, zip guns, and explosive weapons are generally prohibited unless federally registered, Texas does not impose a waiting period for firearm purchases. Additionally, the state allows qualified individuals to carry concealed handguns with the appropriate permit.
