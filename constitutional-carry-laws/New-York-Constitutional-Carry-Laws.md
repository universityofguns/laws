### New York Gun Control Laws

New York has some of the strictest gun control laws in the United States, particularly following the enactment of the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013, known as the NY SAFE Act, in response to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of New Yorkâ€™s restrictions on carrying handguns in public in the case of New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen.

In response, New York swiftly passed the Concealed Carry Improvement Act in July 2022 to impose new restrictions. However, a federal district court temporarily blocked the law in October 2022. Shortly thereafter, a federal appeals court granted emergency relief to New York, allowing the Concealed Carry Improvement Act to take effect and remanding the case to the district court for further review.
