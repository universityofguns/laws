### Wyoming Gun Control Laws Overview

Wyoming gun control laws are among the least restrictive in the United States, placing few obstacles to gun ownership and purchase. In 2021, Wyoming ranked 5th highest in gun death rate among the states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly half of firearm-related deaths in the U.S. come from suicide, and four in ten come from homicide.

Wyoming seeks to balance individual rights to bear arms set forth in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution with legitimate public safety concerns. It must also comply with federal firearm restrictions, including prohibitions on ownership or possession of firearms by individuals under indictment for or convicted of a felony, those convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense, and those currently subject to a domestic violence protection order.

### Wyoming Gun Control Laws

Every state has its own gun control laws that restrict the purchase and use of firearms. Wyoming, known as the Cowboy State, has relatively lenient gun control laws:

  * **No License Required** : Wyoming law does not require a license, permit, or registration to buy or own a firearm.
  * **Minimum Age** : The minimum age to buy a long gun (rifle or shotgun) is 18, and the minimum age to buy a handgun (pistol or revolver) is 21.



### Permitless Carry

  * **Residents** : Wyoming adopted a permitless carry law for residents in 2011, allowing those who would qualify for a concealed carry permit to carry without a permit.
  * **Non-Residents** : This law was expanded in 2021 to cover otherwise qualified non-residents.



### Concealed Firearms Permit (CFP)

The state maintains a CFP for residents seeking reciprocity in other states. A state permit also lets permit holders forego an otherwise required background check when purchasing a new firearm from a federally licensed dealer.

### Obtaining a Concealed Firearms Permit

  * **Authority** : The Wyoming Attorney General‚Äôs office issues permits. To apply for a CFP, contact your local sheriff‚Äôs office. The sheriff then forwards your permit application to the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) for review and background check.
  * **‚ÄúShall Issue‚Äù State** : Wyoming is a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, meaning that if you meet all the objective eligibility criteria, they must issue the concealed handgun permit.
  * **Validity** : Permits remain valid for five years. The state can pursue revocation if a permittee becomes ineligible in the future.



### Prohibited Locations for Firearms

Wyoming law includes a list of prohibited locations where carrying a firearm is not allowed:

  * Facilities used primarily for law enforcement or by a law enforcement agency
  * Detention facilities, prisons, or jails
  * Courtrooms (unless excepted by the judge)
  * Meetings of governmental entities
  * Meetings of the legislature or its committees
  * School, college, or professional athletic events not related to firearms
  * Places that sell liquor for consumption on premises
  * Elementary and secondary schools
  * College or university facilities (unless with consent of their security)



### Other Regulations

  * **Assault Weapons and Ghost Guns** : Wyoming law does not regulate the possession of assault weapons or ghost guns, which are firearms that can be assembled from a kit or through the use of a 3D printer.
  * **Background Checks** : No background checks are mandated for purchasing a gun through a private sale.
  * **Waiting Period** : There is no waiting period from the time of purchase to the time of delivery when buying a firearm.
  * **State Preemption Law** : Wyoming bans local authorities from passing stricter gun laws than the state.
  * **Firearms Manufactured in Wyoming** : A state law provides that firearms manufactured and not leaving Wyoming in interstate commerce do not fall under federal regulations, though this law has never been tested in court.



### Relevant Statutes
