### U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s Role

Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, such as New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), emphasize individual rights to gun ownership, overturning state laws that impose strict criteria for concealed carry permits unless based on objective standards.

### Idaho Gun Laws Overview

### Federal and State Laws

Federal firearms laws apply universally, prohibiting certain firearms like post-1986 machine guns except for specific entities. States like Idaho can impose additional restrictions, including permits for purchase and concealed carry licenses.

### Restrictions and Regulations

Idaho law prohibits certain weapons and imposes age restrictions, with no waiting period for firearm purchases. Assault weapons and ghost guns are not banned but must comply with federal guidelines.

### Locations Where Firearms Are Prohibited

Idaho restricts firearms in specific locations, including schools, courthouses, juvenile facilities, and certain public entertainment venues owned by universities.

### Permitless Carry Law

Idaho enacted a permitless carry law in 2016, allowing law-abiding citizens not otherwise prohibited from firearm possession to carry concealed weapons statewide without a permit. Retired law enforcement officers also qualify under this law.

### Concealed Weapons License

While permitless carry is permitted, Idaho offers concealed weapons licenses for reciprocity with other states. Applicants apply through their county sheriffâ€™s office, guided by the Idaho State Police and Attorney Generalâ€™s resources.

### State Preemption

Idaho maintains state preemption, ensuring uniform firearm regulations across municipalities and counties without stricter local laws.

This overview highlights Idahoâ€™s approach to firearm legislation, balancing individual rights with public safety concerns through comprehensive state and federal regulations.
