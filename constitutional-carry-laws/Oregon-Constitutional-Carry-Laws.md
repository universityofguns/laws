### Federal and State Gun Control Laws

While some firearms regulations originate from federal mandates, the responsibility for enacting and enforcing gun control laws primarily falls on individual states. These laws often vary significantly from state to state, reflecting local customs and attitudes toward firearms. Requirements for purchasing and carrying guns can range widely, with some states imposing strict permitting processes and waiting periods, while others maintain fewer restrictions.
