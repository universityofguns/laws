### Laws Regulating Firearms in Michigan

Laws regulating the purchase, possession, use, and carrying of firearms vary from state to state. Concerns about gun violence grow with each mass shooting, and the prevalence of firearm-related deaths in childhood accidents and suicides raises issues about gun safety.

State legislators may respond to these matters with stricter gun regulations, often trying to balance public safety with the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Michigan gun laws reflect that struggle, with the state falling somewhere in the middle of the pack in terms of gun control.

### Federal Firearms Law

Federal gun laws navigate many of the same challenges seen at the state level. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the publicâ€™s right to bear arms while federal law enforcement agencies seek to control and regulate dangerous weapons.

The federal government provides licensing requirements for gun dealers and enforces prohibitions to keep guns out of the hands of felons and other prohibited persons. Under federal law, a licensed gun dealer must refer all gun purchases for a criminal background check prior to delivery. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) assists in this process.

### Michigan Gun Control Laws

In Michigan, tragedy has brought changes in the law and in the resolve to hold violent offenders accountable. In 2021, a Michigan student shot and killed four students and injured seven others at Oxford High School. In 2023, a lone gunman on the campus of Michigan State University killed four students and injured seven others before taking his own life.

State prosecutors convicted the high school shooter, obtaining a sentence of life in prison without parole. They also charged both parents of the shooter with four counts of involuntary manslaughter for buying the gun used in the crime and disregarding their sonâ€™s mental health issues and threatening behavior. Both parents were convicted by juries in separate trials.

### New Laws

The Michigan legislature enacted new gun regulations after these incidents, becoming the 21st state to adopt a red flag law. In Michigan, family and household members, law enforcement, and health care providers can file for a court to issue an extreme risk protection order. The law provides an opportunity for a court to hear evidence of whether a person presents a serious risk of physical harm to self or others if they have access to a firearm.

The state also closed legal loopholes to provide universal background checks on all firearm purchases. Gun buyers will now be subject to a background check whether the purchase occurs before a licensed dealer or through a private sale. State lawmakers also imposed firearm prohibitions on those with misdemeanor domestic violence convictions and passed a safe storage law to help prevent children from accessing loaded firearms.

### License and Carry Laws

Unlike some states, Michigan requires that citizens apply for a purchase license before buying a firearm, including handguns and long guns. Sales records of handgun purchases must be shared with law enforcement. The state also requires that citizens who want to carry a concealed firearm must first obtain a concealed pistol license (CPL). As a result, the state vets anyone purchasing a firearm by running a criminal background check prior to the delivery of the weapon.

The Michigan State Police provide information on the concealed carry permit process. Those who have a valid CPL do not have to obtain a purchase license each time they buy a firearm.

Michigan provides a list of restricted locations where gun owners generally cannot take a firearm. These include:

  * Schools
  * Depository financial institutions, their subsidiaries, and their affiliates
  * Churches and other houses of worship
  * Courts
  * Theaters
  * Sports arenas
  * Daycare centers
  * Hospitals
  * Licensed liquor establishments
  * Dormitory or classroom of a university or college



There are often exemptions for law enforcement officers, security personnel, and those with a valid CPL. Gun owners should verify the status of a particular location in advance.

In 2020, issues related to security at the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing arose after armed protesters arrived in the building opposing the extension of state lockdown orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the Michigan State Capitol Commission adopted a no-weapons policy within the Capitol building. Exceptions to the policy are severely limited.
