### Overview of Gun Control Issues

Gun control remains a contentious issue in the news. On one side, there is the right for citizens to bear arms for self-defense, while on the other, there is concern for public safety due to mass shootings. Federal gun laws have seen little change, leaving states like Minnesota to find a balance through their own legislation.

### Federal Law

Federal law on gun control begins with the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states:

‚ÄúA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.‚Äù

In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to possess a gun for self-defense. More recently, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), the Court extended this right to carrying firearms in public. These rulings have significant implications for state regulations, which must align with the historical framework for firearms regulation in the U.S.

The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) regulates interstate commerce in firearms, requiring manufacturers, sellers, and importers to obtain a federal firearms license. It also bans ownership of machine guns and sets forth categories of persons prohibited from firearm possession, such as felons and those convicted of domestic violence. The Brady Act amendments established the National Background Check System (NICS) and a minimum waiting period for background checks.

### State Law

Federal law provides a baseline for firearm regulation, with states often adding further regulations. These may include waiting periods, registration requirements, concealed carry permits, and additional prohibitions on firearm possession.

### Minnesota Gun Control Laws

### Firearm Registration

Minnesota does not require firearm registration. Traditional rifles and shotguns can be purchased without a permit, but a handgun purchase requires a valid permit, including a background check. Purchase or transfer of pistols or semi-automatic military-style assault weapons also requires a permit.

### Permits and Background Checks

Applicants for a gun permit in Minnesota must undergo a criminal background check through the Minnesota Crime Information System and NICS. Permits can be obtained from local police chiefs or county sheriffs.

A permit is also required to carry a gun in public. Minnesota is a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, meaning permits are issued based on objective criteria without discretionary denial by officials.

### Specific Situations and Exceptions

A permit is not required to:

  * Keep or carry a firearm at home, business, or land under one‚Äôs control
  * Transport a pistol from the purchase point to home, business, or for repairs
  * Carry a pistol between home and business
  * Carry a pistol for hunting or target shooting in designated areas
  * Transport a pistol in a motor vehicle, snowmobile, or boat if unloaded and secured



Minnesota law prohibits firearms on school property, including campuses, school buses, and childcare centers when children are present. It also has a state preemption law preventing local governments from enacting conflicting firearm regulations.
