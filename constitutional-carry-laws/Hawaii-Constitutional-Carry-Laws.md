### Evolution of Concealed Carry Laws

In 2022, Hawaii‚Äôs concealed carry permit regulations faced challenges following the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), which struck down ‚Äúmay issue‚Äù licensing practices. The Court affirmed a public carry right under the Second Amendment, prompting Hawaii to reassess its permitting criteria.

### Permit Requirements and Background Checks

Hawaii mandates permits for firearm purchases, requiring applicants to undergo comprehensive background checks covering local, state, and national databases. Disqualifying factors include felony convictions, violent misdemeanors, and domestic violence charges.

### Firearm Registration

Nearly all firearms in Hawaii must be registered with local law enforcement agencies, reinforcing accountability and tracking within the state.

### Recent Legislative Changes

In 2023, Hawaii introduced a new licensing framework aligning with the Bruen decision, moving towards a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù policy contingent on objective criteria and firearms safety training. Legal challenges ensued, particularly concerning location restrictions for carrying firearms in public.

### Prohibited Locations for Carrying Firearms

Under Hawaii‚Äôs updated law, carrying firearms is restricted in various public and private locations, including:

  * Government buildings
  * Medical facilities
  * Correctional facilities
  * Alcohol-serving establishments
  * Educational institutions
  * Public transit facilities
  * Recreational areas excluding shooting ranges



### Legal Challenges and Pending Appeals

Parts of Hawaii‚Äôs new firearm legislation, particularly location restrictions, faced legal opposition. A federal court issued a temporary restraining order pending appeal, reflecting ongoing judicial scrutiny.
