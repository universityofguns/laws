### Federal Firearms Law

Federal regulations, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, impose taxes and restrictions on firearms, targeting weapons such as machine guns and silencers. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to prevent prohibited individuals from purchasing firearms.
