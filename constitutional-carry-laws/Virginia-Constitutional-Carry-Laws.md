### Federal Firearms Law

Federal regulations, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, impose taxes and restrictions on firearms, targeting weapons such as machine guns and silencers. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to prevent prohibited individuals from purchasing firearms.

### Washington State Gun Control Laws

Washington State has implemented robust firearm laws, reflecting a commitment to gun safety and violence prevention strategies.

#### Regulation of Gun Purchases and Sales

Recent legislative initiatives include:

  * **Universal Background Checks (2016):** Mandates background checks for private firearm sales through licensed dealers.
  * **Red Flag Law (2017):** Allows courts to issue extreme risk protection orders to prevent firearm possession by individuals posing a threat.
  * **Minimum Age Requirement (2018):** Raised the minimum age for purchasing handguns and semi-automatic rifles to 21.
  * **Waiting Period and Firearms Safety Training (2023):** Requires a waiting period and proof of firearms safety training for all gun purchases.



#### Concealed Carry License Requirements

To carry a concealed firearm in Washington, individuals must apply for a concealed pistol license (CPL) and meet specific eligibility criteria, including age requirements and passing a background check.

### Location Restrictions for Firearms

Even with a CPL, firearms are restricted in various locations such as courtrooms, schools, mental health facilities, and certain public areas like airports and libraries. Open carry is prohibited in these locations.

Washington prohibits assault weapons, large-capacity magazines, and bump stocks, with limited exceptions for certain groups like law enforcement.

### Child Access and Vehicle Restrictions

Minors under 18 face restrictions on firearm possession, and specific storage requirements apply to prevent unauthorized access. Carrying a loaded pistol in a vehicle requires compliance with CPL regulations.

The Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Title 9, Chapter 9.41 covers definitions, possession, carrying regulations, concealed pistol licenses, background checks, and restrictions on dangerous weapons.

#### Illegal Arms and Waiting Period

Possession of machine guns, bump-fire stocks, undetectable firearms, and modified firearms is illegal. A 10-day waiting period applies after firearm purchase for background checks.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

Applicants for a CPL must meet stringent criteria, including age requirements, background checks, and legal status under state and federal law.

### Machine Gun Laws

Ownership and possession of machine guns are generally prohibited in Washington, except for certain exemptions under federal law.
