### Overview of Gun Control Laws

Gun control laws remain a controversial topic in the United States. Gun owners point to the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. Both state and federal governments struggle with the need to balance gun rights with the public‚Äôs right to be free of gun violence.

Gun laws identify what types of guns should be illegal, if any, and what conduct or behavior by a person can cause them to lose the right to possess or own firearms.

### Federal Gun Laws

Any understanding of federal gun laws begins with the Second Amendment, which states, ‚Äúa well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.‚Äù

In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to provide an individual‚Äôs right to keep and carry guns for self-defense and other lawful reasons. This view of a constitutional right to arms has led to closer scrutiny of state and federal firearms regulation.

Key federal gun laws derive from Congress‚Äôs ability to regulate interstate commerce in firearms. In 1934, Congress passed the National Firearms Act (NFA) to regulate and tax manufacturers, owners, and purchasers of certain dangerous weapons used by organized crime.

In 1968, Congress updated the NFA when it passed the Gun Control Act. It expanded its licensing of firearms dealers and categories of those who were prohibited from possessing guns. It later set up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.

If you purchase a firearm from a licensed federal dealer, the gun won‚Äôt be delivered until the completion of a criminal background check that shows that the purchaser is not in a prohibited category.

### Mississippi Gun Laws

### Background Check Loophole

Mississippi law does not close the background check loophole. State law does not require that private sales and transfers of firearms occur via a licensed dealer with a background check.

### Waiting Period and Weapon Restrictions

Unlike some other states, there is no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and when delivery takes place. Mississippi does not ban assault weapons or large-capacity magazines of ammunition.

### Age Restrictions

There is no minimum age to own or possess a rifle or shotgun. You must be at least 18 years old to own or possess a handgun under most circumstances.

### Permitless Carry Law

In 2016, the state adopted a permitless carry law. This law allows a person 21 years of age or older to carry a concealed pistol, revolver, or stun gun on their person without first obtaining a permit and passing a background check as long as they are not prohibited under state or federal law.

### Concealed Carry Definitions

In Mississippi, concealed means hidden or obscured from common observation. If a person carries a handgun in a sheath, belt holster, shoulder holster, or case that is partially visible, the law does not view that as concealed.

### Carrying a Firearm Without a Permit

You also do not need a license or permit to carry a firearm on your person at your dwelling, place of business, or in your motor vehicle.

### Concealed/Enhanced Carry Permits

The Mississippi Department of Public Safety maintains a concealed/enhanced carry permit process for those permit-holders who seek reciprocity to carry a concealed handgun in another state. Applicants must pass a criminal background check, provide their fingerprints, and pay a license fee.

Enhanced permit holders must complete an approved firearms training course. Those with an enhanced permit can also carry concealed in certain areas where firearms are prohibited for the general public.

### Exemptions

Members of the Armed Forces, active law enforcement, and honorably retired law enforcement officers are granted an exemption from the permit law. Mississippi is a shall-issue state, meaning that if you meet the objective criteria and pass a background check, the state must issue the permit.

### Restricted Locations for Firearms

Certain locations remain off-limits for firearms in the state. These include:

  * A place of nuisance (where more than one act of lewdness, prostitution, or illegal drug activity occurs)
  * A police, sheriff, or highway patrol station
  * Prisons, jails, detention facilities
  * Courthouse or courtroom except for the judge or persons authorized by the judge
  * Polling places
  * Meeting places of a governing body, including the Legislature and its committees
  * School and college facilities, unless they are used for authorized firearm-related activity
  * School, college, or professional athletic events not related to firearms
  * Parts of establishments that are primarily involved with dispensing alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises
  * Passenger terminal of an airport
  * Designated facilities for those with intellectual disability or illness
  * Churches and other places of worship
  * Places where the entity or person in charge has placed written notice that carrying a pistol or revolver is prohibited
  * Parades or demonstrations that require a permit
  * Locations where firearms are prohibited under federal law



### Enhanced Concealed Carry Permits

However, those holding an enhanced concealed carry permit may carry a firearm in all the above locations, with a few exceptions. Enhanced permit holders cannot carry in:

  * A courtroom during a judicial proceeding or as otherwise prohibited by the judge
  * A place of nuisance
  * A police, highway patrol, or sheriff‚Äôs station
  * A detention facility, prison, or jail
  * A privately owned place where the owner or person in charge bans firearms



### Preemption Law

Mississippi has also enacted a preemption law that prevents counties and cities from passing ordinances stricter than state laws regulating possession, carrying, transportation, sale, transfer, or ownership of firearms, ammunition, or their components.

This law has exemptions that allow local governments to regulate the discharge of firearms in city or county limits and the carrying of firearms in public parks, riots, political rallies, parades, and other situations.
