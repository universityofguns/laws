### Gun Control Laws in the United States

Federal and state gun control laws impose restrictions on the purchase, use, and possession of firearms across the United States. These laws vary significantly from state to state.

Given the limited gun control legislation from a divided Congress, state legislators face the challenge of balancing concerns about gun violence with the rights of law-abiding gun owners. In Ohio, a majority of lawmakers prioritize gun rights over increased regulation, resulting in fewer restrictions compared to some other states.

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution plays a crucial role in shaping gun laws. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the individual right to own guns for self-defense and other lawful purposes. The court evaluates the constitutionality of laws restricting firearm possession based on historical perspectives regarding gun regulations at the time of the Constitution‚Äôs adoption.

### Ohio Gun Control Laws

Ohio‚Äôs gun control laws prohibit certain types of weapons and regulate gun purchases and ownership for specific individuals. Prohibited possessions in Ohio include sawed-off shotguns, improvised firearms known as zip guns, and military-grade weapons and ammunition. Notably, the state has not banned assault weapons or undetectable firearms (‚Äúghost guns‚Äù).

Certain individuals are restricted from owning or possessing firearms under Ohio law, including convicted felons, individuals with substance abuse issues, and those adjudicated as mentally incompetent. Ohio does not mandate a waiting period for firearm purchases. Federally licensed dealers conduct criminal background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) before delivering firearms. Private sellers or unlicensed dealers are not required to perform such checks.

Ohio does not specify a minimum age for firearm possession, but individuals under 18 cannot purchase firearms, and those under 21 cannot purchase handguns, with exceptions for law enforcement and active-duty military members aged 18 and above.

### Ohio Concealed Carry Laws

In 2022, the Ohio General Assembly enacted permitless carry legislation. This law allows qualifying adults aged 21 and older, not prohibited from firearm possession under state or federal law, to carry concealed handguns without a concealed handgun license (CHL). Applications for a CHL are submitted to the local sheriff‚Äôs office or a neighboring county sheriff for residents and non-residents working in Ohio.

Ohio maintains its concealed carry permit system to facilitate permit-holders‚Äô travel to states with reciprocity agreements.

While Ohio permits open and concealed carry, certain locations prohibit firearms. Prohibited locations include law enforcement facilities, state correctional facilities, airports, government buildings, schools, and places of worship. Private property owners can restrict firearms on their premises with proper signage.

### Overview of Ohio Gun Control Laws

Ohio‚Äôs main gun control statutes are outlined in the Ohio Revised Code (O.R.C.), Title 29, Sections 2923.11 through 2923.30, focusing on weapons control. These laws cover various aspects, including concealed carry without a license, possession in liquor permit premises, and restrictions near school safety zones.

Ohio prohibits specific firearms, including automatic firearms, sawed-off firearms, and certain firearm modifications. The state does not impose waiting periods for firearm purchases but restricts possession by individuals like fugitives from justice, those under indictment for felonies, and individuals with mental health adjudications.
