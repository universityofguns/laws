Alabama boasts a thriving hunting culture, attracting enthusiasts from all corners of the state.Â 


The diverse Alabama hunting landscape offers opportunities to pursue game such as quail, turkey, rabbit, deer, and doves in a balanced ecosystem conducive to the sport.


To ensure fair and sustainable hunting, the state has implemented a comprehensive set of laws and regulations, primarily focusing on migratory animals.


Alabama's commitment to hunting is underscored by the revenue it generates through this pastime. This substantial income is reinvested in the form of Wildlife Management Areas and supports the state's rich physiographic diversity, ranging from sandy beaches in the south to rugged mountains in the north.


The naturally varied landscapes cater to a broad spectrum of hunting preferences, accommodating the diverse socio-economic and ethnic makeup of Alabama's hunting community.


Alabama's Hunting Rules and Regulations
---------------------------------------


Hunting, as defined by Alabama's legislature, encompasses a wide range of activities, including shooting, trapping, capturing, and disturbing wild animals and birds. Even assisting in hunting activities is considered hunting itself.


The state has established several hunting regulations, including the following key provisions:


### Distance Restrictions


Alabama prohibits hunting or discharging firearms within a minimum distance of 50 yards from public areas such as highways and roads. Specific firearms, like shotguns with more than four shots, muzzle rifles, or firearms with a .40 caliber or higher, fall under this restriction, primarily affecting deer hunting. This law aims to enhance safety across Alabama.


### Hunting Permission


Hunting, capturing, or injuring game on someone else's property without their consent is illegal in Alabama. Exceptions apply when the landowner accompanies the hunter or grants guest privileges.


### Hunting Hours


Alabama regulates hunting hours, allowing lawful hunting only during daylight periodsâ€”30 minutes before sunrise to 30 minutes after sunset.


### Body Protection Requirements


Falling from trees is a common hunting injury in Alabama. To mitigate this risk, the state mandates full-body protection with a body harness when hunting from tree stands. Hunters must also use a pull-up rope for equipment retrieval and unload their firearms while raising them. The use of removable tree stands is encouraged, with permanent stands requiring landowner permission.


Alabama Hunting License, Permits, and Tags
------------------------------------------


Prior to obtaining an Alabama hunting license, completing a state-approved hunter education course is mandatory. Exceptions apply to law enforcement agents, military personnel residing in the state, and Alabama National Guard members.


### Required Hunter Education


Alabama hunter education is compulsory for those born on or after August 1, 1977. The minimum age for course enrollment is 10 years, although a hunting license cannot be obtained until the age of 16. Early completion of the hunter education course is advisable.


### Hunter Education Exceptions


The Alabama Wildlife Heritage Act of 2007 offers an alternative to the hunter education course. This option allows license buyers to hunt under the supervision of a mentor. However, those who prefer independent hunting must complete the required course. Supervised hunting requires adherence to voice commands and staying within 30 feet of the supervisor, who must be at least 21 years old.


### Alabama Hunter Education Course Options


Hunters can enroll in an Alabama hunter education course through physical or online classes. Physical classes are free, while online courses involve a provider's fee. Successful completion of either class qualifies hunters for an Alabama hunting license. Physical classes provide hands-on training and cover topics like hunting regulations, survival skills, and firearm safety. Online classes offer educational videos, interactive games, and comprehensive instruction.


#### Physical Hunter Education Course


The physical course requires a minimum of 8 hours of instruction and includes topics such as hunting regulations, survival skills, muzzleloading, game care, wildlife identification, and safe firearm handling. The State Wildlife and Freshwater Fishery Division provides instructors, and the course is open to those aged 10 and older.


Hunters with disabilities can contact the Alabama Division of Wildlife and Freshwater Fishery for accommodations.
