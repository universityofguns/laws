Hunting in South Carolina


South Carolina is one of the states in the United States that offers a diverse range of hunting opportunities, from deer to turkeys and other small game species. Both resident and non-resident hunters enjoy hunting in the state.


 **Hunting regulations in South Carolina**
------------------------------------------


South Carolina hunting rules are laws and restrictions that must be followed by all hunters. Some of the most important ones are as follows:


###  **Baiting in South Carolina**


Anyone who kills, shoots, or attempts to shoot, inures, hunts, takes or attempts to take, or has hunting weapons and firearms to take wildlife and games from any form of elevated place or tree within at least 300 feet of baited areas is prohibited.


Baited areas, according to South Carolina hunting regulations, are areas where food or any other item meant to entice game animals has been exposed or distributed.


Farmland areas for crop harvesting, on the other hand, are not baited regions, regardless of whether they contain any food products commonly used to attract birds or game animals.


In South Carolina, there is an exception to the baiting ban for deer hunting. Hunters are permitted to take deer from trees and elevated elevations within baited zones, regardless of the legal distance.


###  **Regulations Concerning Trespassing**


Before taking game on private lands, hunters must seek a permit from the landowners. An exception is only permitted if the hunter owns the land. Hunters will also be held accountable for any damage to private property. Regardless of whether they issue a permit to hunt on their property, landowners will not be held liable for the injuries of hunters.


###  **In South Carolina, the use of bows and arrows is prohibited.**


The following are some of the illegal uses of bows, arrows, and archeries in South Carolina:


* The use of arrows with poisoned or explosive points is prohibited. It is also illegal to have such an arrow in your possession when hunting.
* It is illegal to use an edged head arrow to hunt down game birds while they are in flight.
* Regardless of the hunting season, it is illegal to hunt game with a bow within an hour and 30 minutes after nightfall and an hour before sunrise.
* It is illegal to take game animals with a bow and arrow from cars in the state, whether they are moving or not.
* When hunting in South Carolina, it is illegal to carry weapons or archery in your possession.
* It is illegal to transport your crossbow in a cocked position while in a vehicle.


###  **Closed-Season Hunting in South Carolina**


Some games in South Carolina do not have specific hunting and trapping regulations. Bobcats, sandhill cranes, grouses, mourning doves, and fishermen are among the games on this list.


###  **Regulations for Hunting Dogs in South Carolina**


It is illegal to allow your hunting dog to go loose when hunting. Hunters are permitted to train their hunting dogs during the day, but not with guns. However, training dogs is prohibited during South Carolina hunting seasons.


In addition, no hunter should train dogs to hunt opossums and raccoons in Wildlife Management Areas. However, exceptions are permitted during certain times of the year, such as between the 1st of September and the 1st of October and between the 1st of March and the 1st of May. Training hours will be between an hour after dusk and an hour before sunrise during these times.


It is illegal to use hunting dogs to capture or pursue animals such as deer and black bears. It is also illegal to track these injured dogs. However, hunters in South Carolina with a valid permit may use the services of qualified dog handlers to track and recover injured game in the state only during the game's specific hunting season.


###  **Regulations for Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles**


It is illegal to use drones or any sort of remotely controlled unmanned aircraft to trap, take, hunt, track, harass, recover, or scout wildlife and game animals unless allowed by the government in charge.


###  **Regulations for Falconry Hunting**


It is illegal to utilize a raptor to hunt without a South Carolina Falconry permit or a state hunting license. It is also illegal for anyone under the age of 14 to hunt any game with the help of raptors. Sunday hunting of migratory game birds with raptors is likewise prohibited under South Carolina hunting restrictions.


In South Carolina, only hunters who pass the required examination and demonstrate that they have the necessary facilities to house raptors will be awarded a falconry permit. Only experienced falconers can sponsor apprentices or beginning falconers.


It is illegal in South Carolina to hold guns while hunting raptors.


###  **While hunting, open carry is permitted.**


While hunting in the state, you may open carry. During archery season, however, you are not permitted to openly carry or possess guns.


The following are the provisions of South Carolina's weapon harassment law:


* Nobody must obstruct or attempt to obstruct the movement of anyone engaged in legitimate weapon hunting.
* Nobody shall erect a barrier to prevent admission and exit from any area of wildlife where hunting activities are permitted.
* Nobody shall attempt to make any illegal physical contact with a licensed hunter.
* Nobody shall take part in any attempt to rob or destroy any hunting property in the state.
* Nobody is permitted to disturb or attempt to alter the natural surroundings of a property licensed for legitimate hunting activities.
* Nobody shall trespass on any public or private land or water intended for hunting without first obtaining permission from the owner or the authorized authority.
* Nobody shall provoke a commotion by making gestures that annoy or impede others from engaging in authorized hunting activities.
* During legitimate hunting sessions, no one shall place themselves in the path of a fire.


You cannot use your weaponry to play during the primitive seasons. This season, the only weapons available for hunting are archery equipment and muzzleloaders.


South Carolina has hunter harassment laws that make it illegal for anyone to intentionally prevent another person from participating in licensed hunting or associated activities such as fishing or trapping.
