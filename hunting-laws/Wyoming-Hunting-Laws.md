Hunting in Wyoming

Wyoming appears to be more popular for its stunning terrain than for its hunting opportunities. However, it is one of the states with excellent hunting chances, particularly for large game such as antelopes, turkeys, bears, elk, bison, turkeys, mountain lions, and deer. Wyoming has approximately 130 hunting zones.

## Hunting regulations in Wyoming

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department enforces hunting laws and regulations that all hunters in the state must follow, whether they are residents or visitors. The following are some of the most important laws and regulations:

### Wyoming General Hunting Regulations and Laws

These are some of the permissible and illegal hunting activities in Wyoming. Among them are the following:

- Crossbows, longbows, shotguns with a maximum gauge of 10 gauge, handguns, rifles, and air guns are permitted hunting weapons in Wyoming. Any other sort of firearm is prohibited unless the Department of Natural Resources makes a specific exception.
- Except for turkeys and migratory birds such as rails and waterfowl, the use of electronic calls is permitted while hunting. It is also permissible to employ electronic sounds to hunt crows.
- It is illegal to highlight wildlife and games from cars, as well as to illuminate vehicle headlights. This is true whether or not the vehicle is utilized for hunting purposes.
- If you are hunting, chasing, or pursuing furbearers at night, you must use a continuous, visible light that is at least a quarter mile away. Only one white light is permitted for two or more people hunting or trapping furbearers at night, and it may be in the custody of any of the hunters. However, for hunting games such as raccoons, foxes, and coyotes with an electronic call from a standing position, a single light beam of any color is permitted.
- It is illegal to use any other hunting weapon or gadget while pursuing coyotes with hunting hounds from sundown until sunrise.
- Hunting from motor vehicles is prohibited; however, exceptions are provided for boats and any other sort of agricultural machinery approved for farm purposes. Small game hunting from boats or other types of power craft is prohibited; however, some small species, such as muskrats, otters, and minks, are exceptions.
- It is illegal to utilize airplanes or drones while hunting in Wyoming or to aid in any Wyoming hunting activity.
- The use of poisoned and explosive-coated arrows is prohibited while hunting in Wyoming. It is also illegal to attach crossbows or longbows to any electrical or mechanical device with features capable of illuminating light beams.
- It is illegal to discharge a firearm across a Wyoming highway or public road.
- It is illegal to hunt any game other than waterfowl between 30 minutes before sunrise and 30 minutes after sunset during deer firearm season, youth deer firearm season, and deer muzzleloader season if you do not wear the required vest, overall, or jacket in either solid hunter orange or camouflage orange. This regulation applies to both public and private hunting properties in Wyoming.
- Only lawful game can be hunted with crossbows and longbows in Wyoming. However, the use of crossbows for migratory game birds is prohibited. Longbow hunters are permitted to use either a standard-handed release device or a mechanical device with operational safety. Hunters may cock crossbows with a device as long as the device has working safety and a stock length of more than 25 inches.

### Wyoming Concealed Handgun License for Hunting

You may conceal a pistol while trapping or hunting if you have a Wyoming concealed handgun license. It is, nevertheless, illegal to use a pistol to kill, shoot, or try to shoot at wildlife or game animals.

### Hunting with Firearm Suppressors in Wyoming

If you are permitted to use firearm suppressors or silencers under Wyoming or federal law, playing legal games with the suppressor is not prohibited. To use the suppressor in this scenario, you must have a valid Wyoming license.

### Permission Hunting in Wyoming

Before hunting on Wyoming private property, you must first receive formal permission from the proprietor for either trapping or hunting, regardless of whether the land is posted or not. Landowners who want to hunt on their property can make an exception. Private land hunting permits are available via the Wyoming Department of Natural Resources' wildlife division's district offices.

### Game Possession in Wyoming

Wyoming's regulations on game and animal possession include the following:

- It is illegal to capture or sell live animals such as furbearers, reptiles, birds, and amphibians. Those with propagation permissions are granted an exception.
- Sales of furbearer hides taken during the open season must not exceed the open season limit; otherwise, they must be retained for sale after the season ends.
- It is illegal to take furbearers alive during open hunting and trapping seasons.
- To buy dry or green fur in Wyoming, you must have a valid state fur dealer's permit.
- It is unlawful to purchase, possess, or exchange nongame birds and their body parts, whether living or dead.

### While hunting, open carry is permitted.

It is permissible to open carry when hunting in Wyoming, although using firearms to take wildlife during bow hunting or an archery season is prohibited.

Wyoming's hunter harassment statute specifies that it is illegal to intentionally hinder licensed hunting in the state by:

- interfering with a person who has a license to engage in legitimate hunting.
- Participating in an activity that endangers wildlife or alters their behavior in such a way that it inhibits authorized hunting

Furthermore, it is prohibited to:

- Disobey any order from a peace officer or law enforcement official to stop engaging in any action that violates this section of the law.
- Disobey the advice of any group urging its members to discontinue any illegal action.
