Delaware game hunting


Delaware is the second-smallest state in the United States, yet it still has plenty of hunting chances. It is more popular for deer hunting than for any other game or species, and it holds the record for the number of deer taken in the United States.


Regulations for Delaware Hunting
--------------------------------


In Delaware, hunting is strictly regulated. The state has tight restrictions in place to safeguard game and animal harvesting. If you want to go hunting in Delaware, you must first grasp all of the criteria and restrictions imposed by the state Fish and Wildlife Division.


The following are some of Delaware's hunting regulations:


### Hunting Regulations in General


* Delaware Sunday hunting is not permitted. Exceptions are made during the fox season for commercial red fox hunting. In addition, pending legislation allows deer hunting on Sundays during deer seasons. However, it is best to check with the Wildlife Division first.
* It is illegal to hunt in Delaware unless you have a valid state license. The state also outlaws taking more games than the specified bag limitations, as well as possessing games obtained illegally.
* In Delaware, hunting is prohibited within 100 yards of an occupied structure. This requirement is waived if the hunter owns the building or obtains permission from the property owner to hunt on its premises. Also, for bow-and-arrow deer shooting, a hunter must be 50 years away from an occupied building. For individuals hunting with a firearm, counties such as Newcastle mandate a 200-yard radius from occupied structures.
* It is illegal to discharge a hunting firearm fewer than 15 yards from a public road. It is also illegal to fire a firearm across a public road.
* Trespassing on private lands and properties with a rifle or trap without authorization from the landowner is illegal. It makes no difference whether or not the land contains a sign prohibiting the use of guns.
* It is illegal to destroy any wildlife, game animal, bird cave, den, or nest.
* The use of artificial light on animals for hunting games is prohibited. This restriction also applies to light emitted by cars.
* During Delaware hunting, you are not permitted to utilize devices that allow night vision or infrared.


### Regulations Concerning Firearms and Archery


* While hunting in Delaware, you may not have a loaded firearm or cocked crossbow in or on your vehicle.
* It is illegal to transport muzzleloader rifles with a charge in their barrel. If the firearm primer or cap has been removed or the firearm is in an enclosed case, this restriction is waived.
* It is illegal to hunt at night, and the nighttime is defined as 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise. There are exceptions to this rule for hunting opossums, frigates, and raccoons with the use of a handheld light source.
* It is illegal to hunt games using a shotgun that is larger than 10 gauge, an automatic firearm that fires more than once when the trigger is pulled, or a centerfire rifle. There are exceptions for hunting predators such as foxes and coyotes with a centerfire rifle.
* In Delaware, it is illegal to use a shotgun with more than three shells for hunting. There are exceptions for hunting snow geese.
* It is illegal in Delaware to take or try to take game or wildlife using poisoned arrows or arrows with explosive points.

### Regulations for Hunting Furbearers

* In Delaware, it is illegal to hunt or capture muskrats with a dog.

Other Delaware hunting regulations are as follows:


* It is illegal to sell or exchange wildlife, games, or animal parts. Those who obtain approval from the Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife may make an exception. If you are a hunter and wish to ship games taken legally in the state, you must first obtain a notarized declaration proving that the game was taken legally. The document must also include the sender's information and the number of games packaged.
* It is illegal to shoot wild birds, such as owls and hawks. Delaware only allows legal bird-game hunting for sparrows and starlings.
* Having live wildlife and game animals in your hands is illegal.
* It is illegal to bring live rabbits from other states into Delaware without a health certificate.
* Allowing hunting dogs to run at large is illegal. Private properties are granted exceptions to allow the dog to run from October 1st to February 18th. The dogs may only run on the owner's property.
* It is illegal to let hunting dogs run at large between the hours of sunset and morning at any time of year. In addition, hunting dogs in Delaware must be registered.
* It is illegal to use bait to hunt game. The only exception to this is hunting for deer on privately held state property.
* It is illegal to release swine animals into the wild, charge a fee for hunting swine, or shoot at swine without a state hunting division license.
* It is illegal to harvest deer antlers using traps or any other technology that removes antlers from the game. You can openly carry a handgun or a shotgun when hunting in Delaware. However, open carry is not permitted in the state when bow hunting.
* Delaware also has legislation against hunter harassment. The legislation stipulates that no one shall intentionally interfere with or disrupt a legitimate hunting activity in the state, which includes taking aquatic species such as fish, frogs, crabs, oysters, and so on, as well as hunting game such as birds or other animals.
