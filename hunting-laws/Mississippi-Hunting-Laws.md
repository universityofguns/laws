Hunting in Mississippi


Even if some of the hunting opportunities in Mississippi are subpar, the state still has some excellent species to hunt, including turkeys, deer, and small game animals. It is also one of the states in the United States where alligator hunting is permitted.


Hunting Regulations in Mississippi
----------------------------------


Mississippi, like most states in the United States, has hunting restrictions, laws, and standards that hunters must follow.


The taking, trapping, pursuing, searching, shooting, stalking, killing, and snaring of wildlife, games, and fishes protected by the Mississippi Department of Natural Resources is characterized as hunting. It also makes no difference if the game is killed or damaged during the action.


The following are some of the most important Mississippi hunting regulations:


### Hunting Mishaps


If you are engaged in any type of hunting mishap involving the use of a firearm, and the accident results in a personal injury or property damage worth more than $100, you must report the accident within the next 12 hours.


The accident must be reported to the local county sheriff's office or any local conservation office. If the sheriff's office and the local conservation office are both closed, you must report the accident to the Mississippi Department of Natural Resources if it occurred between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.


### Obtaining a License


On public or private hunting lands, hunters must have a valid Mississippi hunting license with them. You must show the license or any legal permit, tag, and stamp to peace officers and landowners in charge of the property where you are trapping or hunting upon request. The license might be either physical or electronic.


### Game Animal Possession and Storage


You may not exceed the bag limit of any game or fur-bearing animal that you obtain legally with a valid license when hunting in Mississippi until the first day of the next open season of that game.


As long as the animal is taken legally, you are allowed to possess approximately 25 pounds of deer meat known as venison during deer hunting in Mississippi.


### Communication Device Use


It is illegal to utilize a two-way communication equipment to direct hunters, stalk game animals, or locate their movement and position. There is an exemption for coyote hunting, where hunters may use 2-way radios. Additionally, falconers with a valid state falconer permit may utilize a one-way mobile transmitter to capture free-flying birds. When using a hunting dog, you can employ a one-way mobile transmitter to track or recover the dog.


### Games from Other Countries


You can legally possess games that were lawfully taken from other states and legitimately imported into Mississippi if you can verify that they were both lawfully taken and imported. However, there are occasional exceptions to this rule for major sporting events.


### Games for Retrieving and Wasting


It is illegal to abandon game animals that have been injured while hunting without making any effort to collect them. Similarly, it is illegal to abandon any useable piece of game animals after taking them. This regulation's definition of usable portion includes:


* A game animal component that is frequently processed for food.
* The hide and fur of fur-bearing sports.


### Transport of Hunting Weapons


It is illegal to have or carry a handgun in your vehicle on Mississippi public highways. There are exceptions to this rule for firearms that are enclosed in their case, as well as those with unattached magazines and ammo. In addition, handguns must be transported in a closed container and must be unloaded. Anyone in the vehicle should also be unable to access the firearm.


Muzzleloaders must be either cased or unloaded. When the priming charge is not in the pan or the cap is not in the nipple, muzzleloaders are considered empty.


### Hunting Near Structures


It is illegal to discharge or try to discharge a firearm for the purpose of shooting game animals within 200 yards of a residential building or a building containing feedlots or domestic livestock.


Exceptions to this rule are permitted if you obtain permission from the landowner or a renter living in the residential structure.


According to this rule, a feedlot is a structure used to hold animals and feed them until they reach slaughter size.


### In Mississippi, open carry is permitted while hunting.


While hunting in the state, you can open carry your firearm, and this includes bow hunting.


To conceal carry when hunting in Mississippi, however, you must have a state permit.


To safeguard hunting activities, Mississippi has hunter harassment statutes, which include the following:


* Nobody shall intentionally interfere with a licensed hunting activity in the state or the authorized taking of wildlife games.
* Nobody shall disturb wild animals in such a way that the animals' behaviors are affected, making authorized hunting activities impossible.
* Nobody shall interrupt or harass anyone engaged in legitimate wildlife hunting in Mississippi.
* Nobody must trespass on private or state-owned land to engage in hunting without the consent of the property's owner or the authority in charge.

Mississippi Wildlife, Recreation, and Fishing
---------------------------------------------


The following are some of the most popular games and wildlife hunted in Mississippi:


### Hunting for deer in Mississippi


Deer are common in Mississippi River valley counties. They prefer the most fertile land locations, and the fertility level of the land usually determines the grade of deer that can be found there. Because the delta and batture areas contain some of Mississippi's most fertile soils, deer are abundant in these locations.


### Alligator hunting in Mississippi


Alligators are widely distributed in Mississippi, with a high concentration in counties such as Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson. The presence of alligators has been documented as far north as Coahoma and Tunica counties in Mississippi.


### Hunting for ducks in Mississippi


Wetland areas, particularly those away from human settlement, are ideal for duck hunting in Mississippi. Duck hunting will be good in wildlife refuge regions with lakes, rivers, and ponds. Ducks are typically found in shallow parts of the state's water basins.


### Hunting for turkey in Mississippi


The eastern wild turkey is the most common wild turkey in Mississippi, and it may be found in practically every region of the state, but mainly in the Mississippi River's eastern reaches.


### Hunting for Hogs in Mississippi


Hog hunting is popular in Mississippi due to its even distribution throughout the state. However, there are several hotspots for duck hunting in Mississippi, particularly in the southeast, southwest, and delta regions.
