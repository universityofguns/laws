Hunting in Vermont


Vermont is one of the states to visit for hunting in the northeastern United States. Hunting has a long history in the state, and it was the first to include hunting laws in its constitution.

Vermont has hunting rules, regulations, and standards that everyone who wants to hunt in the state must follow. The following are some of the most essential hunting requirements in the state:


###  **Unlawful hunting behavior**


Unlawful hunting conduct in Vermont is defined as any taking, transportation, or possession of game animals, wildlife, or any part of the body when the animal's specific season has passed, unless approved by Vermont wildlife and fishing statutes.

Vermont prohibits the selling of some game birds and animals, including the following:

###  **Buying and selling deer, bears, and moose**

A Vermont Hide License is required before you can commercially buy, sell, or exchange untanned hides of game animals, including those of fur-bearing games or other body parts of wildlife and birds. Furthermore, any portion of wildlife or game animals you buy or sell cannot be tied to wildlife or wild birds that are banned from being sold in Vermont.


###  **Vermont during night hunting**
