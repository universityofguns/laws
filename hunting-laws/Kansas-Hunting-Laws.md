Kansas Hunting


The hunting scenery in Kansas consists of games like deer, turkey, elks, and other small game animals. The state also helps hunters with several programs such as Kansas Sportsmen Assisting Disabled Sportsmen program that help disabled hunters by pairing them up with other hunters.


Another opportunity for hunters is the Walk-in Access hunting program where private landowners in the state will grant access to hunters to take various games within their property.


Then there is the hunter referral program for deer hunters where private landowners that have abundant deer on their property will open the land for hunting.


Kansas Hunting Regulations
--------------------------


Hunting in Kansas is heavily regulated with laws and requirements that hunters must compulsorily abide by. Some of the most important hunting regulations in Kansas include the following:


### Trespassing


It is a prohibition to hunt, trap, shoot or attempt to do these activities on lands owned by private owners without consent from the owner or the person put in charge of the land.


Also, if you are to hunt from public roads in the state, and there is private land adjacent to the roadside, you are still required to seek the permission of the landowner before hunting.


But hunting is prohibited on federal and state highways of Kansas. For lands that have a post requesting written permission for hunting and trapping, it is illegal to enter them without getting a permit.


Furthermore, it is a prohibition to erect blinds on poles and treestands for hunting, regardless of if they have been abandoned.


### Collecting and Giving Games


Any game that is given or gifted to another person must carry the details of the hunter that offered the gift. The details must include the following:


* Hunterâ€™s name
* Hunterâ€™s permit number or transaction number
* Hunterâ€™s license details
* Hunterâ€™s address
* The date the hunter gifted the game
* Hunterâ€™s signature.


### Selling Games


It is a prohibition to sell game carcasses or meat taken in Kansas. Also, you cannot sell games at charitable events.


### Wasting Games


It is a prohibition to waste games in Kansas when a game has been injured, crippled, or killed, it is the responsibility of the hunter to find the games and retrieve them. Hunters are obligated to keep retrieved games until they are either consumed, processed, or given away to take to the hunterâ€™s home.


### Prohibited Activities While Hunting in Kansas


Some of the unlawful activities that are prohibited for Kansas hunting include the following:


* It is a prohibition to make use of drugs, coated arrows, chemicals, or any other substance that can incapacitate a game animal while trying to hunt the animal.
* It is a prohibition to shoot a firearm at a game, hunt, or pursue game animals with vehicles such as motorboats, airplanes, land vehicles, etc. Exceptions are allowed for the hunting of waterfowl games with a motorboat that is powered off, or whose sailing has ceased, you can also pursue coyotes with vehicles. Also, hunters with disabled permits can hunt with vehicles.
* It is a prohibition to make use of a two-way communication device or a mobile cell phone to aid in the hunting, pursuing locating of big game animals and fur-bearing animals. Any mechanical means of communication is also prohibited by this regulation.
* It is a prohibition to make use of live decoys while hunting in Kansas.
* It is a prohibition to draw game animals out with electronic calls. However, exceptions are allowed for coyote hunting, furbearers hunting, crows hunting, and geese hunting during conservation order.
* It is a prohibition to cast spotlights or make use of headlights and any other type of artificial light for hunting or taking games in regions of the state like grasslands, woodlands, forested areas, highways with the aid of hunting weapons such as firearms, archery, etc. However, there is an exception to this prohibition that allows the use of light sources like, battery flashlights, handheld lanterns, and lamps with firearms such as .17 and .22 rimfire rifles to take trapped games such as furbearers, coyotes, etc.
* It is a prohibition to shoot at migratory bird games like quail, pheasants, doves, etc. unless they are in flight. Exceptions are allowed for the shooting of turkeys in flight and on land.


### Non-Toxic Shots


Non-toxic shots are approved for the hunting of games such as geese, coots, ducks, rails, moorhens, etc. You can make use of nontoxic shots for shotgun hunting in some of the Kansas wildlife refuges. It is the responsibility of a hunter to find out if nontoxic shots are allowed in a wildlife refuge before hunting.


### Use of Tags


Big game animals or turkeys that are found dead in Kansas can only be possessed after tagging them with the state KDWPT salvage tag. You are not allowed to cut off antlers or possess their skulls without having the salvage tag. For other dead game animals, you can possess them in their specific seasons with their valid Kansas license and the required bag limits.


### Checking Hunters


It is the duty of Kansas law enforcement officers to enter lands and hunting fields and request the licenses of hunters or check their bag limits. For this reason, hunters must compulsorily be in possession of their hunting license whenever they are out to hunt.


Furthermore, hunters are obligated to allow a law enforcement officer to complete the required check and inspection of their license, permits, tags, and any game animals they have taken.


### Prairie Dogs Hunting Kansas


Before you can hunt prairie dogs in Kansas, you must have a valid state hunting license to hunt with the dog. Kansas issued a prairie dog hunting license for residents and non-residents. Hunting of prairie dogs is allowed throughout the state, and there are no bag limits or closed seasons for the game. However, since most prairie dog hunting in Kansas takes place on lands owned by private owners, they are required to obtain a permit from landowners before hunting on their property.

Wildlife, game, and fish hunting
--------------------------------


The following are some of the most popular hunting games in Kansas:


### Kansas deer hunting


Kansas is home to two deer species: the white-tailed deer and the mule deer. Mule deer are more frequent in the western half of the state, where they live in habitats such as red hills, smoky hills, and high plains. However, as you drive further east in Kansas, the number of mule deer decreases and white-tailed deer becomes more numerous.


### Kansas Turkey Hunting


Turkey hunting is popular in Kansas, and it is one of three states in the country with excellent turkey hunting possibilities. Most Kansas public hunting sites are ideal for turkey hunting, but the most popular include Milford, Toronto WMAs, Tuttle Creek, the Fort Riley military hunting area, and a number of others.


### Kansas Antelope Hunting


Antelope hunting in Kansas is quite good, with approximately 3000 games located in state parks and wildlife. They are more widespread in western Kansas, particularly in Wallace and Greeley counties, thanks to transplanting efforts that began in these counties around 1964, according to the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Tourism, and Parks.


### Kansas Elk Hunting


Elk hunting in Kansas is mostly concentrated in the Ft. Riley wildlife area. Personal elk hunting or small elk herds are permitted in several sites throughout the state. Except for Morton County, elk hunting is legal in all of Kansas with a valid license.


### Rabbit hunting in Kansas


The swamp rabbit and cottontail rabbit are two of the most common rabbit species in Kansas. The swamp rabbit is found in southeast Kansas, and as the name suggests, it prefers swampy areas and river borders. Because they are semi-aquatic games, they thrive in wetlands and shrublands. The cotton-tailed rabbit, on the other hand, lives largely in cities and suburbs in the United States. However, they are widely distributed throughout Kansas. They also have distinguishing physical characteristics, such as a brown upper body and a white belly.


### Duck hunting in Kansas


Duck hunting is popular in Kansas' wetland areas, where they prefer to remain away from human habitation. They can be found in shallow areas of water bodies, such as lakes and ponds.


### Crow hunting in Kansas


Kansas can be found in the state's forest areas, particularly around rivers, streams, and agriculture areas. They also live in the state's suburbs and orchards.
