Hunting in Tennessee


Tennessee is one of the most traditional hunting states in the United States. Deer, turkeys, elk, and a variety of small game animals are among the games available in the state.


Tennessee Hunting Rules
-----------------------


While hunting in Tennessee, sportsmen must follow hunting laws, standards, and regulations. Some of these laws apply exclusively during specific hunting seasons, while others apply regardless of the game season.


The following are some of Tennessee's most important hunting laws:


### Clothing requirements for hunters


All hunters and their aids are required to wear an orange-colored outer garment material. During firearm seasons, muzzleloader firearm seasons, or elk and bear firearm seasons, the color must be visible from the head, chest, and back regions.


The dressing rules for dove and waterfowl hunting seasons, on the other hand, are not mandatory.


You can utilize mesh material for your hunter gear; however, your mesh weave should not be larger than 14 of the measures. If you wear an orange outfit, a little pattern of other colors may appear.


### The following are some of the Tennessee Hunter orange apparel violations:


* It is illegal to wear orange clothing with camouflage patterns and no other orange color on the chest, head, or back.
* It is illegal to wear hunting attire to a stand and then remove it when you reach the stand.
* It is illegal to hunt rabbits, birds, and squirrels without the required attire.
* It is illegal to hunt deer and elk during firearms seasons without complying with the hunter's orange dressing requirement.
* It is illegal for archery or crossbow hunters to hunt during firearm seasons without wearing the requisite orange cloth.


Anyone hunting deer with a rifle in some WMA must ensure that the blind has hunter's orange material affixed and is visible from all sides. In addition, hunters in the blind must wear orange apparel. During the weapon seasons, hunters are not permitted to set up hunting blinds or wear orange clothing on WMA or Tennessee public hunting properties where the taking of animals such as bears, elks, and deer is prohibited.


### Tennessee Shooting Schedule


Most game species in Tennessee typically have shooting hours between 30 minutes before sunrise and 30 minutes after dusk. Regardless, hunters are permitted to be on hunting grounds and stand prior to the shooting hours. There are several exceptions to these shooting hours, such as opossums, frogs, coyotes, and raccoons.


Hunters may take opossums and raccoons during the day or at night, with the exception of the modern firearm deer shooting season, when opossums and raccoons may only be taken at night.


### Methods of hunting that are prohibited


Illegal hunting activities in Tennessee include the following:


* It is illegal in the state to discharge firearms, archery devices, or a similar hunting weapon or equipment across a major road or public highway in the name of hunting.
* Taking or attempting to take games and wildlife with a vehicle or automobile is prohibited, regardless of whether they are protected or unprotected by the state hunting agency. There is an exception for boat hunting.
* It is illegal to use hunting dogs or a horse to pursue animals such as turkeys, elk, and deer while on horseback. The employment of dogs to locate turkeys during the fall turkey season is an exception to this rule.
* It is illegal to capture bears, elks, or deer when they are swimming.
* Giving bears food, whether directly or indirectly, is prohibited, regardless of the reason.
* It is illegal to capture game or wildlife using explosives, fire, smoke, chemicals, or gas.
* Baiting game animals is prohibited in all Tennessee wildlife management areas.
* It is illegal for elk and deer hunters to utilize electronically generated calls or any type of decoy to attract the animals.
* Taking turkeys when they are roosting is illegal. Roosting refers to any location where a turkey spends the night, but it is most commonly found on trees.
* It is illegal in Tennessee to use live turkeys as decoys when hunting wild turkeys.


### Games of Chance


It is illegal to use bait or attempt to hunt bears and wild turkeys in locations where bait is already present. This rule also applies to game baiting in Tennessee private hunting areas. Under this law, any previously baited place is still deemed baited for 30 days after the baits are removed.


Baited areas are lands or locations where items that can attract game, such as grains or feeds, have been placed in order to attract game such as turkeys, deer, and bears.


However, hunting is not forbidden in regions where grains or other feed substances exist as a result of agriculture activities or crop growth for wildlife control.


Restriction Devices and Game Calling Devices


In Tennessee, the following methods of game calling are permitted:


* To attract all of the game species you want to take, you can utilize hand- or mouth-operated sounds.
* During their lawful hunting season, you can employ electronic calling devices to attract furbearers.
* To catch crows during their hunting seasons, you can employ electronic or mechanical sounds.
* It is, however, illegal to use or possess electronic calls during elk, deer, and turkey hunting seasons.


### While hunting, open carry is permitted.


Tennessee gun law enables anybody to openly carry a firearm when hunting in the state, as long as the firearm is handled in accordance with gun rules.


For the protection of hunting activities, the state also has hunter harassment legislation.


The legislation specifies that no one shall intentionally interfere with or impede hunting activities in the state, including fishing, trapping, and the like.
