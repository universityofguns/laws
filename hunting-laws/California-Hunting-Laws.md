California Game Hunting
-----------------------


Only two states in the United States have more lands for games and wildlife than California. The state offers a variety of hunting options. Some state inhabitants engage in hunting as a recreational activity in order to spend more time with others. The California Game and Fish Department also promotes hunting because it aids in ecosystem conservation.


Regulations for Hunting in California
-------------------------------------


Hunting in California, like in other states in the United States, is strictly restricted to ensure that wildlife does not become extinct very soon. The state has several laws and regulations in place, and it is critical that hunters follow them. Among these regulations are the following:


### Using Lead Projectiles to Capture Wildlife


The California Fish and Game Commission forbids the use of lead projectiles or ammunition containing lead projectiles for game and wildlife hunting in the state.


This regulation states that:


* Shots, pellets, bullets, slugs, or any other item fired with force from a firearm are examples of projectiles.
* Non-lead ammunition includes any type of projectile-loaded centerfire, muzzleloading, or shotgun ammo.
* This regulation also stipulates that it is illegal for non-lead missiles to have more than 1% lead.


### It's shooting time!


According to this regulation, when the California Game and Fish Commission specifies a shooting period for hunting specific games and times, it is specific to the hunter's area. This means that allusions to sunrise and sunset are dependent on the hunter's location.


### Vehicles are used to pursue games and wildlife.


It is illegal to follow, herd, or pursue wildlife and games with any sort of motor vehicle, including land vehicles, motorboats, aircraft, and snowmobiles. This legislation also prohibits hunters from utilizing a motorized vehicle, aircraft, or similar flying devices to locate or assist in the location of games and wildlife within 48 hours of hunting a large game in an area.


This regulation makes an exception for an airboat, sailboat, or motorboat that has been switched off and is only driven by a paddle or rests at anchor.


There is also an exception for the use of these vehicles by a landowner or a renter on a private property to pursue wildlife and games to keep them from causing damage.


If you obtain a license from the California Fish and Game Commission, you may be excluded from using automobiles to hunt.


### Animal exploitation


While hunting in California, it is illegal to harass or pursue wildlife and game. Harassment under this legislation is defined as a purposeful act to disrupt game and wildlife behaviors such as eating, breeding, and dwelling. This legislation is exempt for landowners or renters of private property who hunt wildlife to prevent harm to the property.


### Providing food for large animals


It is illegal in California to feed big game or mammals, with the exception of hunters who have permission from the California Fish and Game Commission.


### Possession of large animals, mammals, and furbearers


It is illegal to acquire or keep a migratory bird after the time limit set by the state's game commission. You may also not take these games beyond the hunting limit.


Mountain lions may only be kept in California if a permit issued by the commission for the taking of such a game is obtained.


This regulation also stipulates that any big game, mammals, or bird game captured by hunting or trapping in California and in the possession of a hunter will be killed immediately and counted as part of the bag limit for that hunting season.


### Possession of game birds


It is illegal for a hunter to possess more than the bag limit for the bird game. There is an exception to this rule for storage, transportation, shipping, and cleaning services, where someone can carry and retain birds captured legitimately by other hunters in the state.


However, in instances like this, it is mandatory for the game to wear a tag that provides the hunter's information.


Furthermore, all birds caught in California must have their heads and feathered wings in place. Birds that have been placed in a personal residence or are being prepared for consumption are exempt from this rule. Doves, on the other hand, must have their feathered wings attached.


In California, the possession of migrating birds is restricted to one per individual hunter.


### Hunting with Remote Computers


The use of any form of remote technological gadget to hunt in California is prohibited by the Game and Fish Commission.


It is illegal to create a computerized hunting site for distant game and wildlife hunting within the state. This regulation defines computer remote hunting as the use of any form of device or computer that can be controlled remotely. This covers hardware, software, and technology. It also includes hunting equipment such as archeries, rifles, and other weapons capable of remotely killing game and wildlife.


### Using Baits to Catch Game and Wildlife


It is illegal to use bait to hunt resident game birds and mammals in the state. The distance specified for this is within 400 yards of the baited area. This law defines a baited area as any location where salts, grains, wheat, or any other sort of feed has been deposited, scattered, or spread. Such an area will stay baited for 10 days after the meal has been fully withdrawn.


### Californians go out at night to hunt.


It is illegal to hunt within one and a half hours after nightfall and before sunrise in counties such as Monterey and San Benito.


### Using light to hunt


The use of lights of any voltage is permitted when hunting fur-bearing games in the state. However, using lights to hunt deer at night is prohibited throughout the general deer season.
