Hunting in West Virginia

Hunting is a significant source of revenue in West Virginia. Despite the fact that West Virginia is one of the smallest states in the country, more than 300,000 people participate in the state's hunting season for large game such as deer, bears, turkeys, and other small game species.

## Hunting Regulations in West Virginia

West Virginia, like the rest of the country, regulates hunting and trapping with laws and requirements that sportsmen must obey.

The following are some of the most important hunting restrictions in West Virginia:

### West Virginia Hunting License

A state hunting license is required before you can hunt any game in West Virginia. West Virginia provides several hunting licenses for residents and non-residents. It is illegal to hunt without a current state hunting license.

### West Virginia Tagging Requirements

Certain animals must be tagged after being hunted. Deer and turkeys are examples of these animals. Hunters must be aware of all tagging regulations for the sports they wish to participate in, and the animals must be appropriately tagged to avoid infringement.

Hunters must first obtain hunting tags before they can go hunting for animals such as turkeys and deer. The tag must be attached immediately after hunting the game and before the animal is transported from the hunting field.

Hunters must also label their tags with relevant information, such as a date, the zone where the hunting occurred, and any other pertinent information. The tag must be kept on the carcass when it is transported for storage or to the hunter's home after the animal has been tagged. Furthermore, the tag must remain attached to the carcass while the hunter is still in camp.

### Tag verification and validation

Validating game tags for animals, such as turkeys and deer, is required. The validation must be completed within 72 hours of playing the game. It is possible to do so using the West Virginia game check system.

Tags can also be validated by phone calls or the West Virginia Department of Fisheries and Wildlife's website. If a check station is provided, hunters who harvest deer in specific Wildlife Management Areas can validate their deer tag within the WMA. It is the hunter's obligation to determine whether a WMA has a deer check-in station and whether the station is open throughout the hunting season.

### West Virginia Hunter Dressing Regulations

Orange and pink are the approved colors in West Virginia for certain game animals such as white-tailed deer, and it makes no difference what sort of hunting firearm is utilized. However, the quantity of pink or orange hue acceptable for hunting will vary depending on the type of hunting and if the hunter is on public or private property in West Virginia.

The following are some of West Virginia's hunting clothing regulations:

Hunters on private state properties are permitted to wear at least 400 square inches of the required pink or orange color in body regions such as the chest, back, and head. According to this law, they can also wear an orange or pink cap with the required inch size.

Hunters who harvest deer during the lawful deer rifle season must wear at least 400 square inches of the pink or orange color on their head, chest, or back.

Hunters who shoot from stands or elevated floors on private land in the state are exempt from the dressing requirement. However, if private land authorizes the use of hunting rifles, there is an exception. In this situation, they must conform to the 400-square-inch minimum criteria for the orange or pink hue to be worn on their head, back, or chest when going to the stand or elevated floor and when returning.

Archery hunters who take wildlife on hunting lands that do not allow the use of guns are exempt from the dressing rule.

### West Virginia Hunting Bag Limits

Hunters must adhere to the bag limit for the animal they wish to take as well as the hunting season in which they participate. Bag restrictions are used to limit the quantity of specific game animals that can be taken during the course of a hunting season.

Depending on the type of animal, bag limitations may be daily or seasonal. Daily bag limitations will limit the number of games that can be played in a single day. Seasonal bag limitations limit the number of games that can be taken between the beginning and conclusion dates of a hunting season.

Bag limits are set by the West Virginia Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and vary depending on the quantity of species available that year. Violating bag restrictions will result in consequences such as a fine or license revocation.

### West Virginia allows open carry when hunting.

West Virginia allows open carry when hunting. You can also use any caliber of rifle while bow hunting.

### Hunter Harassment Law in West Virginia

West Virginia has hunter harassment statutes in place to safeguard such behavior within the state.

Nobody in the state shall engage in the following activities on wildlife and in seas controlled by the government or private individuals where a hunting license is available:

- To prevent the taking of such creatures, disrupt the authorized hunting of wildlife animals by hunters or fishing of aquatic animals by fishermen.
- disturbing wild animals by engaging in activities or creating a barrier that alters animal behavior and interferes with hunting.
- Disturb any hunter or fisherman who is lawfully carrying out his or her activity in order to dissuade or discourage them from doing so.
- Trespassing on any wildlife or aquatic body with the goal of violating any provision of the hunter harassment statute.
- Trespass on any privately owned, unnavigable water body with the intent to hunt any animal without first obtaining authorization from the landowner.
