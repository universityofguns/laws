Hunting in Montana


Big game hunting in Montana mostly consists of bison, bears, elk, antelopes, and mountain lions. It is one of the best places in the state for non-residents to attend major sporting events.


Montana also has a number of initiatives to assist with hunting throughout the state. The Block Management Program, for example, encourages private landowners to enable public hunting on their holdings. This program has resulted in around 7.8 million acres of land being made accessible for hunting, although they are only available during the fall season and cannot be used for hunting species such as turkeys and bears in the spring.


Hunting regulations in Montana
------------------------------


Montana has hunting restrictions in place to ensure that the state's hunting culture is protected and that recent activities do not have an impact on future hunts. The state also encourages hunters and locals to report any type of infringement to the Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Park Department.


As a hunter in Montana, you should be aware of the following hunting regulations and laws:


### Attractions and Luring in Wildlife


It is illegal to use any attractant, fragrance, or deer urine to entice game or wildlife. The use of any edible substance in the capture or hunting of big animals is likewise prohibited by the state. However, exceptions are provided for salt, water, or salt mixtures containing trace minerals that were originally intended for livestock.


### Hunting Without a Permit


Before you can hunt or capture game or wildlife in the state, you must first have a valid fishing or hunting license. Every time you go hunting, you must also have your license with you. If a tag is required for hunting, you must also have one. Before engaging in any hunting activity in the state, the license and tags must be signed.


### Possession of illegally taken games and wildlife


If you take any game or animals illegally, possession of such an animal is forbidden under Montana hunting rules. It makes no difference if you were involved in the hunting or seizing of the wildlife; as long as it was not properly acquired, possessing it is illegal.


### Possession of Wildlife and Bag Limits


The Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Department maintains possession and bag limits for certain species. Wildlife hunting must adhere to the quantity and limitations established by the commission. As a result, it is critical that you conduct a study before capturing wildlife.


### Tagging the Big Game


All big game captured in Montana must be tagged. On the back of the tags are usually instructions for tagging. You must follow the instructions in the letter as well as the Montana Game and Fish Commission's other tagging laws.


### Wildlife hunting during closed seasons, under artificial lights, and during legal hours


In Montana, you can only hunt wildlife and game during the seasons set by the hunting commission. The commission is also in charge of ending hunting seasons, and you may not pursue wildlife during the close season.


If you are a hunter who specializes in a specific species, make sure you gather information on the commission's regulations before going on a hunting trip.


During the state's coyote hunting season, Montana hunting laws ban the use of artificial light. This also means that you cannot use vehicle headlights or spotlights when hunting. However, exceptions are permitted for theft reasons; however, the firearm in the car must not be able to discharge when using the spotlight. It is better to keep all firearms, ammunition, bows, and arrows outside the vehicle or at the camp.


The use of artificial lights to extend hunting and shooting hours is likewise prohibited by the state.


### Hunting from a moving vehicle


Taking games and wildlife from vehicles such as motor vehicles, watercraft, or aircraft is banned. Those who acquire authorization from the Montana Fish and Game Commission are exempt. The term "take" refers to the hunting, killing, catching, pursuing, and shooting of wildlife in the context of this rule.


Furthermore, this legislation states that you may not purposefully drive or hover in a vehicle to look for animals before stealing it. The scope of this rule extends beyond simply shooting an animal from a vehicle; you may even transfer animals in a vehicle. It is also illegal to drive off the main road in order to get closer to wildlife.


### Using devices to hunt


Only devices certified by the Montana Fish and Game Commission may be used to hunt game and wildlife. The use of any other device is prohibited.


### Discharging a firearm in the vicinity of a house


It is illegal to discharge firearms when hunting near a residential building unless you have permission from the residents. This ordinance also prohibits the use of bows and arrows, 35-caliber inflatable weapons, and hybrid weapons. Buildings under this rule also include structures such as cottages, huts, barns, and sheds.


Before hunting near structures, hunters must assume that they are populated. During dove and quail shooting seasons, violations of this restriction are widespread.


### After hunting, clean up.


When hunters finish their activity, they are required to clean up. There should be no litter in camp, and any debris or castings should be removed. This includes cleaning the carcasses of animals. In most hunting jurisdictions, there are restrictions on the disposal of carcasses, and hunters must clean up in accordance with these regulations.


### Shooting across a street


It is illegal for hunters to fire firearms from across the road or a railway while attempting to capture wildlife. These rules apply to bow-and-arrow shooting as well. Hunters should be wary of this rule because it is frequently broken during dove hunting seasons.


### Open Carry of Firearms While Under the Influence of Alcohol


According to Montana law, it is illegal for anyone to handle weapons while under the influence of alcohol or any other intoxicating substance.


### In Montana, open carry is permitted while hunting.


Montana allows open carry while hunting, fishing, hiking, trapping, or participating in any other recreational activity in the state.


It should be noted that you can own a firearm when bow hunting in the state, but you cannot use it.


Montana has hunter harassment regulations in place to protect hunting activities in the state.


Among them are the following:


* Nobody shall intentionally interfere with any hunting or fishing activity involving wild animals, as long as the state licenses it.
* Nobody shall influence animal behavior or disrupt game hunting by employing an object to influence wildlife behavior.
* Nobody shall harass or disturb any person engaged in authorized hunting activity.


Hunting Licenses, Permits, and Tags in Montana
----------------------------------------------


The Montana Fish and Game Department issues a variety of hunting licenses, tags, and permits. Among them are the following:


### Locking Tags for Large Game


This hunting tag is designed specifically for nonresident Montana hunters who want to hunt big game. Montana offers a multitude of hunting tags, and non-resident hunters must buy the ones that are specific to the game they want to hunt. The tag will be applied to the animal as soon as the hunter captures it and will remain on it throughout the processing and exportation of the animal from the state. Some resident hunters may require a hunting tag in addition to an Alabama hunting license issued by the state to take specified game. Brown bears and muskox are two big game species for which resident hunters require tags.


### Stamps of Waterfowl


To hunt waterfowl in Montana, hunters must have both a federal duck stamp and a Montana duck stamp. Hunters will also be required to undergo a harvest information program and provide proof of completion. Furthermore, several areas of the state demand permission before catching or hunting waterfowl in their region.


### Permits for drawing


Every year, from November to December, you can apply for a hunting permit. Residents of the state can obtain the permit, while non-residents can obtain it through a lottery arranged by the Montana Board of Games.


### Permits for Registration


Registration permission is required to participate in registration hunts. It is available for residents as well as nonresidents in Montana.


### Permits by Tier


Tier permits are necessary in Montana for subsistence hunting. Tier I and Tier II permits are available, and only citizens of the state can apply for them. To apply, you must be at least 10 years old.


### A small game allows


Although the majority of the state does not require permission to hunt small game, some areas of Montana do require a permit to hunt small game under their authority.


### Season tickets in general


To hunt and purchase big game in the state during the regular season, hunters will need to purchase tickets, tags, licenses, and permits. All hunters must adhere to the specified dates of the season as well as the bag limits for the games.


### Permits for target hunting


Target hunting in the state reduces the number of animal and car accidents. Residents of the state will be authorized to kill and catch animals that pose a threat to the general population or are predicted to die as a result of wounds and injuries.


### Permits for Auction


In 1997, Montana's fish and game agency began auctioning off big game hunting permits. They use a raffle mechanism, and only the most deserving applicants will receive this auction authorization.


Permits and Tags for Montana Fishing
------------------------------------


Montana fishing licenses are classified as follows:


### Sport Fishing Permit


Citizens of Montana who are 18 years old or older, as well as citizens of other states who are 16 years old or older, must have a Montana sport fishing license before participating in fishing sports or other fisheries activities in the state. This license is the same whether the sport is performed in fresh or salt water. Sport fishing licenses can be purchased online through the state department of fishing and game or at fish and game retailers.


Residents of Montana who are 60 or older, as well as disabled veterans, are permitted to participate in fish sports without a license. However, they must have a valid Montana identification card.


A king salmon stamp is required to catch king salmon. However, citizens under the age of 18 who have a state identity card and non-residents under the age of 16 are excluded.


### Fishing License for Subsistence and Personal Use


This permit is only good for Montana residents who desire to fish for personal or subsistence purposes. Subsistence and personal fishing restrictions differ in Montana. A resident who already has a sport fishing license may utilize it in the state for personal fishing. Sport fishing licenses, however, are not valid in Montana subsistence fisheries.


The following are some things you should know about subsistence and personal use licenses in the state:


* Permits from the Montana Department of Fish and Game are required for certain subsistence and personal-use fisheries.
* Some Montana water bodies are confined to personal use and subsistence fishing.
* The federal government manages and oversees the subsistence fishery for halibut.
* Some fish species have seasons, fishing gear, and a harvesting bag limit.
* Contact the nearest Montana Department of Fish & Game office for subsistence or personal use fishing for shellfish or fish harvesting.
