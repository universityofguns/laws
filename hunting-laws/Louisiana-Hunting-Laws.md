Louisiana Fishing and Wildlife Games
------------------------------------


Louisiana's wildlife and games include the following:


### Deer hunting in Louisiana


There are a lot of white-tailed deer in Louisiana, and the state does a good job of keeping them alive for hunting. As a result, white-tailed deer are the most commonly harvested game in the state. They are widely spread throughout the state and can be found in practically all places, including some coastal areas.


### Turkey hunting in Louisiana


Turkey hunting is more popular in Louisiana today than it was in previous decades. Wild turkeys can be found in practically every section of the state and in every suitable habitat. Every year, an estimated 20,000 hunters participate in the state's turkey hunting season.


### Alligator hunting in Louisiana


Alligator hunting in Louisiana is done in waterbodies such as marshes, rivers, canals, ponds, and lakes. Alligator hunters are picked through a lottery procedure, and only those chosen will be issued an alligator license and tag. To hunt alligators on private land, you must either be the landowner or gain permission from the landowner, but you must have a state alligator license and permit tag.


### Duck hunting in Louisiana


Duck hunting in Louisiana takes place in wetlands such as ponds, rivers, and lakes. Hunters who have access to wildlife refuge areas can also go duck hunting there. Ducks prefer shallow areas of bodies of water.


### Dove hunting in Louisiana


Mourning Dove hunting is highly prevalent in Louisiana, and it is the most popular species of dove found in the state. They can be observed perching in trees or on phone cables outside of residential areas. They also spend a lot of time roaming the grounds, especially while hunting for food.


### Bobcat hunting in Louisiana


The Louisiana Bobcat Refuge is the state's sole wildlife area where bobcats can be found. Bobcats are the only species of wildcat found in Louisiana and live in wooded areas.


### Quail hunting in Louisiana


Estimates for quail hunting in Louisiana reveal that approximately 2,500 of the game birds are taken by approximately 800 hunters in the state each year. Although the figures are lower than in prior years, they are still higher than in other states. The reduction in quail hunting in Louisiana is attributed to habitat deterioration caused by farming activities in Louisiana.


### Raccoon hunting in Louisiana


Raccoons are widely spread in Louisiana because they can thrive in the majority of the state's environments. They can be found in densely forested areas, woodland regions, and pine areas. Raccoons are easily identified by hunters due to their black masks on their faces and their characteristic yellow and black tails.
