Indiana hunting focuses on popular game animals such as deer, squirrels, and turkeys. In addition, there are opportunities to hunt small and woodland game in the state. Raccoons, coyotes, and foxes are among Indiana's predators and furbearers.

Hunters can apply to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for this program.
