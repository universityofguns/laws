Hunting in Pennsylvania


Pennsylvania has both large and small games. According to the Pennsylvania wildlife Commission, there are numerous hunting seasons in the state for various categories of hunters to take wildlife.


Pennsylvania Hunting Laws
-------------------------


Pennsylvania's hunting regulations are strict. The state has tight restrictions in place to safeguard game and animal harvesting. If you want to go hunting in Pennsylvania, you must first grasp all of the criteria and limits imposed by the Pennsylvania Game Commission.


The following are some Pennsylvania hunting regulations:


### Hunting Regulations in General


Pennsylvania Sunday hunting is not permitted. Exceptions are made during the fox season for commercial red fox hunting. In addition, pending legislation allows deer hunting on Sundays during deer seasons. However, it is best to check with the wildlife division first.


* It is illegal to hunt in Pennsylvania unless you have a valid state license. The state also forbids taking games beyond the specified bag limits or possessing games obtained illegally.
* In Pennsylvania, it is forbidden to hunt within 100 yards of an occupied structure. This requirement is waived if the hunter owns the building or obtains permission from the property owner to hunt on its premises. Also, for bow and arrow deer shooting, a hunter must be 50 years away from an occupied building.
* It is illegal to discharge a hunting firearm fewer than 15 yards from a public road. It is also illegal to fire a firearm across a public road.
* Trespassing on private lands and properties with a rifle or trap without authorization from the landowner is illegal. It makes no difference whether or not the land contains a sign prohibiting the use of guns.
* It is illegal to destroy any wildlife or game animal or bird cave, den, or nest.
* The use of artificial light in animals for hunting games is prohibited. This restriction also applies to light emitted by cars.
* During Pennsylvania hunting season, you are not permitted to use night vision or infrared gadgets.


Regulations Concerning Firearms and Archery
-------------------------------------------


While hunting in Pennsylvania, you may not have a loaded firearm or cocked crossbow in or on your vehicle.


* It is illegal to transport muzzleloader rifles with a charge in their barrel. If the firearm primer or cap has been removed or the firearm is in an enclosed case, this restriction is waived.
* It is illegal to hunt at night, and the night time is defined as 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise. There are exceptions to this rule for hunting opossums, frigs, and raccoons with the use of a handheld light source.
* It is illegal to hunt game using a shotgun that is larger than 10 gauge, an automatic firearm that fires more than once when the trigger is pulled, or a centerfire rifle. There are exceptions for hunting predators such as foxes and coyotes with a centerfire rifle.
* In Pennsylvania, it is illegal to use a shotgun with more than three shells for hunting. There are exceptions for hunting snow geese.
* It is illegal in Pennsylvania to take or try to take game or wildlife using poisoned arrows or arrows with explosive points.
* It is illegal to use a swivel rifle or a punt that cannot be fired from the shoulder.


  
 Regulations for Hunting Furbearers


* In Pennsylvania, it is illegal to employ a bait, pen, trap, cage, deadfall, pen, chemical, poison, pitfall, or drug for game-taking. Wildlife and games, such as raccoons, rabbits, foxes, and coyotes, are exempt.
* In Pennsylvania, it is illegal to hunt or capture muskrats using a dog.
* It is illegal in the state to shoot or capture muskrats. The trapping of muskrats is exempt from this rule.


Other hunting regulations in Pennsylvania include the following:


* It is illegal to sell or exchange wildlife, games, or animal parts. Those who obtain approval from the Pennsylvania Division of Fish and Wildlife may make an exception. If you are a hunter and wish to ship games taken legally in the state, you must first obtain a notarized declaration proving that the game was taken legally. The document must also include the sender's information and the number of games packaged.
* It is illegal to shoot wild birds, such as owls and hawks. Pennsylvania only allows legal bird-game hunting for sparrows and starlings.
* Having live wildlife and game animals in your hands is illegal.
* It is illegal to bring live rabbits from other states into Pennsylvania without a health certificate.
* Allowing hunting dogs to run at large is illegal. Private properties are granted exceptions to allow the dog to run from October 1st to February 18th. The dogs may only run on the owner's property.
* It is illegal to let hunting dogs run at large between the hours of sunset and morning at any time of year. In addition, hunting dogs in Pennsylvania must be registered.
* It is illegal to use bait to hunt game. The only exception to this is hunting for deer on privately held state property.
* It is illegal to release swine animals into the wild, charge a fee for hunting swine, or shoot at swine without a state hunting division license.
* It is illegal to harvest deer antlers using traps or any other technology that removes antlers from the game. You can openly carry a handgun or a shotgun when hunting in Pennsylvania. However, open carry is not permitted in the state when bow hunting.


There are also hunter-gatherer harassment laws in Pennsylvania. The legislation stipulates that no one shall intentionally interfere with or disrupt a legitimate hunting activity in the state, which includes taking aquatic species such as fish, frogs, crabs, oysters, and so on, as well as hunting game such as birds or other animals.


###  **In Pennsylvania, open carry is permitted while hunting.**


While hunting in Pennsylvania, open carry of a firearm is permitted. Bow hunting, on the other hand, does not allow the use of firearms to kill an animal.


To protect the activity, Pennsylvania has hunter-harassment regulations in place.


It is prohibited to interfere with hunting in a location where such activity is permitted. This law can be broken in the following ways:


* By disturbing wildlife or game animals, you are interfering with a permitted hunting activity in the state.
* intercepts or harasses a hunter who is participating in licensed hunting or any other connected activity in the state.
* uses any type of stimulation to disrupt wildlife, making hunting more difficult or entirely prohibiting the sport.
* builds a barrier to limit access to areas of the state where authorized animal taking is permitted.
* puts himself or herself in danger while hunting in the state.
* It affects the condition of a property utilized for permitted hunting activities, making it more difficult to successfully hunt game.
* Before hunting, trespass on a public or privately held property without the authorization of the owner or the appropriate authority.
* ignores any instructions issued by a peace officer enforcing any of these laws on licensed hunting property.
