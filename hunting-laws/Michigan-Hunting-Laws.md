Hunting in Michigan


Michigan is a fantastic hunting destination in the United States. In the state, you can hunt elk, turkeys, deer, and other small game animals. Access to private and public lands for hunting is also permitted.


Hunting regulations in Michigan
-------------------------------


Just as it is done in practically every region of the United States, Before taking wildlife or games in Michigan, hunters must follow hunting laws, standards, and regulations. These regulations are enforced by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.


The following are some key Michigan hunting restrictions to be aware of:


### Regulation of Hunting Licenses


You must have a valid Michigan hunting license to take wildlife and games in the state. This is true for both residents and non-residents. There may be exceptions for hunting some games without a license, but only the Michigan Department of Fish and Wildlife can make that determination.


### Regulations for tagging


Certain animals must be tagged after being captured. Big game species such as bears, elk, turkeys, and deer require tagging. Hunters must also be aware of any tagging and taking requirements for the species they wish to hunt. To avoid violating restrictions, tagging must be done correctly.


### Requirements for Tagging


You must first validate the game tag before putting it on the carcass of any large game that requires tagging. It is permitted to put tags on the hides of games like bear, wolf, or lion. You must attach the tag immediately after starting the game. To tag, first remove the triangles surrounding the tag, which show the month and day you are taking the game.


### Dress Code for Hunters in Michigan


Before you go hunting in Michigan, you must comply with the state's hunters' attire regulations for various games. The attire accepted for pheasant and other upland game hunting is orange and at least 36 square inches in size. The clothing should also be higher than the hunter's waistline.


This clothing code applies to hunters on state fish and wildlife lands WMAs as well as those on sponsored hunts in Michigan. However, regardless of what animal they are hunting, the Michigan Department of Fish and Wildlife advises all hunters to adhere to the orange dress code.


### Bag limits in Michigan


Bag limits for hunting in Michigan are used to limit the number of specific games that can be hunted during a given season. Bag limitations might be daily or seasonal, depending on the game being hunted.


For daily bag limits, the hunter will be limited to only a certain number of games per day. Seasonal bag limitations restrict hunters to the number of games that can be hunted during a certain game season.


Bag limitations are not always the same from year to year or season to season. The Michigan Department of Fish and Wildlife sets bag restrictions each year based on the game population. All bag limitations and restrictions imposed by the agency must be followed by hunters. Violating bag limitations may result in fines and the termination of hunting permits.


### Michigan hunting regulations


The following are some of the most prevalent offenses for hunters to avoid in Michigan:


* In Michigan, it is illegal to remove proof of game sex that you have taken. You must leave all sex evidence naturally attached to the game corpse, or the majority of the meat if the game is boned. There are exceptions for games such as bears, wolves, and lions, where the proof of sex must be left on their hide.
* It is forbidden to tag games that require tagging or to tag them incorrectly. To tag the game according to Michigan regulations, remove the month and date notches completely and tag the game as soon as you harvest it.
* It is illegal for hunters to refuse to halt at Wildlife Management Area checkpoints. It is mandatory for hunters and trappers to submit themselves and their hunting equipment for search at every check station they encounter on their way to and from a hunt.
* It is illegal in Michigan to transfer games and wildlife without a proxy statement. A proxy statement is necessary for the shipment of games taken by another hunter. Hunters receive one proxy statement form for each tag purchased.
* While hunting, it is illegal to discharge a firearm across a highway.
* It is illegal to hunt animals during their hunting season. A hunter must be aware of the opening and closing dates of the game season for the animals they wish to take. Hunters must also be conversant with additional laws, such as the species of game that can be taken, the sex that can be taken, and the hunting boundaries. Hunters should also examine the rules every year in case they alter them.
* It is illegal to hunt with an invalid license. Hunters must have the appropriate license for the game they are attempting to capture. This is typical when non-resident hunters purchase Michigan licenses that are only valid for state residents.
* It is illegal for a hunter to transfer a hunting license or tag to another hunter.
* You are not permitted to take a game for another hunter who will affix his or her hunting tag. In Michigan, party hunting is illegal.
* It is illegal for any hunter to trespass on private territory to pursue a game. Exceptions are made for landowners and hunters who have permission from the landowner. Also, hunters must be aware that they are hunting on private property, as ignorance is not an explanation for this infraction.


When hunting big game using motorized vehicles, it is the hunter's responsibility to observe the rules for hunting with vehicles in either state- or federally-held areas.


### While hunting, open carry is permitted.


In Michigan, open carry is permitted for hunting purposes.


When bow hunting, however, you can only conceal carry. You are also not permitted to hunt with guns.


Michigan has rules against hunter harassment, which include the following:


* Nobody shall interfere with hunting activities in the state if they are legitimately licensed by the appropriate authorities.
* Nobody may follow or disturb wildlife or fish in an aquatic area in order to disrupt a legal hunting activity.
* Nobody shall harass or annoy a hunter who is legally taking animals from wildlife or aquatic bodies.
* Nobody shall use any stimulation or technology that has an effect on fish in water or animals in wildlife in such a way that it prevents or makes hunting difficult.
* Nobody must impede the movement of animals in wildlife or fish in water by establishing a barrier to hinder hunting activity; this does not include a barrier built to prevent trespassing in the state.
* Nobody shall place himself or herself in the line of fire to prevent authorized wildlife hunting.
* Nobody shall alter the condition or settings of a wildlife property in such a way that it interferes with the legitimate taking of wild animals or fish in water.
* Nobody must trespass on private or public land or water to engage in hunting without first obtaining permission from the owner or the appropriate authority.
