Hunting in Illinois


Small game and normal game species such as rabbits, deer, and turkeys are available for hunting in Illinois. There are also several bird games in the states.


Hunting Regulations in Illinois
-------------------------------


The Illinois Department of Natural Resources strictly regulates hunting. There are rules, laws, and restrictions that hunters must follow. Some of the most important ones are as follows:


### Regulation of Hunting Licenses


You must have a valid hunting license in Illinois before you can hunt, regardless of whether you are a resident or non-resident hunter. However, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources may allow non-licensed hunting of specific game.


### Regulations for Game Tagging


Some games necessitate tagging and must be examined by hunting officials after being taken. One such game is deer. It is the duty of Illinois hunters to understand all tagging regulations for the games they wish to pursue. Incorrect tagging may result in a violation, which may result in fines or the forfeiture of a hunting license.


### Requirements for game harvesting


The hunter must register deer harvested in Illinois during muzzleloader, archery, and the special Chronic Waste Disease season. In addition, harvested deer in Illinois counties that do not have Chronic Waste Disease surveillance must be registered if taken during a firearm season.


In Illinois, the deadline for registering hunted deer is 10 p.m. on the day the deer was harvested. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources also accepts deer-harvesting registration by phone or on their website.


Counties with CWD surveillance, on the other hand, will demand physical registration of harvested deer at numerous check sites. The hunter will receive a tag after registering the animal. The tag will have a harvest confirmation number. It is critical that the harvested deer stay intact, as it was captured during the hunt.


### Dress Code for Hunters


Some hunting seasons or events in Illinois have dress rules that hunters must follow. This comes in a bright orange color with a pink hat. Hunters must wear it with an outer garment that matches the color standards. Colors such as camouflage, pink, and orange are not permitted.


These dressing criteria are required in order to:


* Take deer during any of the year's deer firearm seasons.
* Track injured deer using a hunting dog during any of the year's deer rifle seasons.
* During any of the deer firearm seasons, keep an eye on young and inexperienced hunters.
* In any of the firearm seasons, you can harvest turkey with archery equipment.


### Baggage Restrictions


Bag limitations are restrictions that hunters can use to limit the number of game animals they can take during a hunting season. Depending on the game animal, the Illinois hunting bag limit might be daily or seasonal. The amount of that specific game that the hunter can take in a day will be limited by daily limitations. A seasonal limit, on the other hand, limits the quantity of certain games a hunter can take during a given hunting season.


Bag limitations vary from year to year. They differ from game to game and are defined by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources based on the population of the game to be taken. Hunters are responsible for knowing and adhering to the bag limit for the game they wish to take. Violations may result in fines and, potentially, license revocation.


### Illinois hunting restrictions


The Illinois Department of Natural Resources forbids the following activities while hunting in the state: possessing a firearm in any of the state wildlife management areas without the approval of that WMA's management.


* It is illegal to possess a snare or any device that acts similarly to a snare, pit trap, net, or deadfall in order to capture game animals. The regulation makes an exception for snares that are not powered by a spring or any other type of motorized device used for hunting furbearer games in bodies of water. However, part of the snare must always be submerged.
* It is illegal for any hunter or individual to take wildlife or games from their home or den using mechanized devices, digging devices, smoke, or other gas compounds to drive them out.
* It is illegal to use small mammals, such as ferrets or hares, to drive wildlife and games from their homes or dens in order to hunt them.
* It is illegal to use hooks, gigs, or spears to hunt games or wildlife protected by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
* It is illegal to employ medicines, poisons, or any type of explosive to take games or wildlife protected by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
* It is illegal to hunt near grasses, bushes, peat bogs, or other flammable substances that are on fire.
* It is illegal in Illinois to use a shotgun with a gauge larger than 10 when hunting or attempting to hunt games and wildlife.
* It is illegal to hunt game birds, migrating birds, waterfowl, and other species using firearms such as rifles, air guns, revolvers, and pistols.
* It is illegal to discharge firearms such as air guns, rifles, revolvers, and handguns into any Illinois water body. This includes the state's frozen waters.
* It is illegal to discharge weapons or archery devices across public roadways or highways when hunting.
* It is illegal to use silencers or other silencing devices to diminish or totally muffle the sound of a rifle when hunting.
* It is illegal to take fur-bearing games from a licensed trapper's traps without the approval of the trap owner.
* It is illegal to hunt on private state property if you are not the landowner or do not obtain permission from the landowner.
* It is prohibited to harvest game with shotguns loaded with slugs. White-tailed deer and fur-bearing games are exempt from this rule. Furthermore, anyone with the approval of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources may violate this restriction.
