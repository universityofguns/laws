New Mexico Game Hunting

The New Mexico habitat is ideal for a variety of games and fauna. Deer, turkeys, mountain lions, bears, and small game animals are some of the most prevalent game species.

## Hunting regulations in New Mexico

New Mexico has hunting restrictions in place to ensure that the state's hunting tradition is protected and that recent activities do not have an impact on future hunts. In addition, the state encourages hunters and residents in general to report any type of infringement to the New Mexico Fish and Game Commission.

As a hunter in New Mexico, you should be aware of the following hunting restrictions and laws:

### Attractions and Luring in Wildlife

It is illegal to use any attractant, fragrance, or deer urine to entice game or wildlife. The use of any edible substance in the capture or hunting of big animals is likewise prohibited by the state. However, exceptions are provided for salt, water, or salt mixtures containing trace minerals that were originally intended for livestock.

### Hunting Without a Permit

Before you can hunt or catch game or wildlife in the state, you must first obtain a valid fishing or hunting license. Every time you go hunting, you must also have your license with you. If a tag is required for hunting, you must also have one. Before engaging in any hunting activity in the state, the license and tags must be signed.

### Possession of illegally taken games and wildlife

If you take any game or animals illegally, possession of such an animal is forbidden under New Mexico hunting rules. It makes no difference if you were involved in the hunting or seizing of the wildlife; as long as it was not properly acquired, possessing it is illegal.

### Possession of Wildlife and Bag Limits

For several species, the New Mexico Game and Fish Commission imposes possession restrictions and bag limits. Wildlife hunting must adhere to the quantity and limitations established by the commission. As a result, it is critical that you conduct a study before capturing wildlife.

### Tagging the Big Game

All large game collected in New Mexico must be tagged. The tags normally have instructions on how to tag them on the back. You must strictly adhere to the directions as well as the New Mexico Game and Fish Commission's other tagging regulations.

### Wildlife hunting during closed seasons, with artificial lights, and during legal hours

In New Mexico, you can only hunt wildlife and game during the seasons set by the hunting commission. The commission is also in charge of ending hunting seasons, and you may not pursue wildlife during the close season.

If you are a specialized hunter, ensure that you obtain information about the commission's restrictions before embarking on a hunting expedition.

Artificial light is not permitted during the state's coyote hunting season, according to New Mexico hunting statutes. This also means that you cannot use vehicle headlights or spotlights when hunting. However, exceptions are permitted for theft reasons; however, the firearm in the car must not be able to discharge when using the spotlight. It is better to keep all firearms, ammunition, bows, and arrows outside the vehicle or at the camp.

The use of artificial lights to extend hunting and shooting hours is likewise prohibited by the state.

### Using vehicles to hunt

Taking games and wildlife from vehicles such as motor vehicles, watercraft, or aircraft is banned. Those who acquire permission from the New Mexico Fish and Game Commission are exempt. The term "take" refers to the hunting, killing, catching, pursuing, and shooting of wildlife in the context of this rule.

Furthermore, this legislation states that you may not purposefully drive or hover in a vehicle to look for animals before stealing it. This rule prohibits not just shooting an animal from a vehicle but also transporting animals in a vehicle. It is also illegal to drive off the main road in order to get closer to wildlife.

### Using devices to hunt

Only devices certified by the New Mexico Fish and Game Commission may be used to hunt game and wildlife. The use of any other device is prohibited.

### Discharging a firearm in the vicinity of a house

It is illegal to discharge firearms when hunting near a residential building unless you have permission from the residents. This legislation also prohibits the use of bows and arrows, inflatable weapons with a caliber of.35, and hybrid weapons. Buildings under this rule also include structures such as cottages, huts, barns, and sheds.

Before hunting near structures, hunters must assume that they are populated. Violations of this restriction are widespread during dove and quail shooting seasons.

### After hunting, clean up.

When hunters finish their activity, they are required to clean up. There should be no litter in camp, and any debris or castings should be removed. This includes cleaning the carcasses of animals. In most hunting jurisdictions, there are restrictions on the disposal of carcasses, and hunters must clean up in accordance with these regulations.

### Shooting across a Highway

It is illegal for hunters to fire firearms from across the road or a railway while attempting to capture wildlife. These rules also apply to bow-and-arrow shooting. Hunters should be wary of this rule because it is frequently broken during dove hunting seasons.

## Hunting licenses, permits, and tags in New Mexico

To hunt animals and wildlife in New Mexico, you must first obtain a valid state license. For both resident and non-resident hunters in New Mexico, the minimum age to apply for a hunting license is ten years old. People under the age of ten are permitted to hunt other wildlife that is not large game as long as they are supervised by a licensed hunter who is at least eighteen years old. During a session, the licensed hunter can only supervise at least two children.

Even if you have a valid hunting license in New Mexico, you will be unable to hunt games if you are under the age of 14 and have not completed the Hunter Education Training Course.

### Hunting License for New Mexico Residents

Residents of the state may purchase a New Mexico resident hunting license. To be considered a resident of the state, you must have lived in the state for at least 6 months prior to applying for a license, permit, or tag. You also cannot be a resident of another state in the United States.

Members of the United States armed forces who are assigned to the state for either permanent or temporary duty may also apply for a New Mexico resident license. Only residents of New Mexico may purchase a resident hunting license in the state. Others are only eligible to apply for a non-resident license.

### Complimentary Hunting Permit

New Mexico provides complimentary licenses to anyone who meets the requirements for free licenses in the state. Free licenses are available for fishing and hunting throughout the state. A free license can only be obtained from the New Mexico Fish and Game Department.

### Pioneer Hunting Permit

This is a sort of resident license awarded in New Mexico to people who are at least 70 years old and have lived in the state for at least 25 years.

### Veteran Disabled Hunting License

To receive this form of license, a veteran must show proof of disability from the state Veteran Administration. The applicant must also have lived in New Mexico for two years prior to applying for the license.

### Apprentice Hunting Permit

In order to improve the state's hunting culture, New Mexico implemented an apprentice hunting license in 2009. The license is free, and the state intends to use it to encourage more people to become hunters.

Licensed hunters in the state will be able to take prospective hunters on hunting trips with a New Mexico apprentice hunting license. Because of the apprentice license, prospective or beginner hunters will not need to obtain a standard license to go hunting.

The license is not just valid for New Mexico citizens, but non-residents can also apply for it for free.

An apprentice license, on the other hand, is only valid for consecutive days and can only be used to hunt small game, fur game, birds, predators, and nongame mammals.

The state Fish and Game Department can issue you an apprentice license. However, before applying, you must have a mentor who is a New Mexico resident and a licensed hunter who is at least 18 years old. In addition, the mentor must not exceed the required number of apprentice hunters per year. Beginner hunters are only permitted to obtain one apprentice license per year.

### Lifetime License in New Mexico

These permits are exclusively available to New Mexico residents. The application fee for a lifetime hunting license in the state is determined by the type of license and the applicant's age.

### Non-Resident Hunting License in New Mexico

Non-resident hunters who want to hunt in New Mexico must obtain a non-permit tag form in order to purchase licenses, stamps, and hunting tags, among other things. They must submit the form to the state's fish and game department separately, without submitting a hunt permit tag application.

### General fishing permits

### Community Fishing Permit

When fishing on public water on a day when fishing is not permitted, you do not need a New Mexico fishing license. In New Mexico, free fishing day is always held on the first Saturday following National Fishing and Boating Week.

If you register to participate in a fishing clinic sponsored by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, you do not need a fishing license.
