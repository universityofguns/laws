Kentucky Hunting


Kentucky hunting consists of big games like bears, deer, and elks, as well as various small games. The state has plenty of hunting opportunities because of its woodlands. Hunters that have licenses for games they want to take will be granted access to take the animals.


Kentucky Hunting Regulation
---------------------------


There are hunting laws, requirements, and regulations for hunters to abide by while taking games in Kentucky. Some of these laws apply to only specific hunting seasons, while others are general laws regardless of the game season.


Some of the most important hunting laws in Kentucky include the following:


### Hunterâ€™s Clothing Requirements


It is compulsory for all hunters and their assistance to wear an outer garment cloth with an orange color. The color must be visible from the head, chest, and back region during the daylight hunting of games in firearm seasons, muzzleloader firearm seasons, or elk and bear firearm seasons.


However, you do not have to follow the dressing requirements for dove and waterfowl hunting seasons.


You can make use of mesh material for your hunter clothing, but the condition is that your mesh weave should not be larger than Â¼ of the measurements. If you are wearing an orange garment, then a small pattern of other colors may be displayed.


Some of the violations against Kentucky Hunter orange clothing include the following:


* It is a prohibition to wear an orange garment that contains camouflage patterns and has no other orange color on the chest, head, or back regions.
* It is a prohibition to wear your hunter clothing to a stand then remove it when you reach the stand.
* It is a prohibition to hunt rabbits, quails, and squirrels without the dressing requirement.
* It is a prohibition to hunt deer and elk firearms seasons without the hunterâ€™s orange dressing requirement.
* It is a prohibition for hunters making use of archery or crossbow equipment to hunt during firearm seasons without the required orange cloth.


For hunting deer with a firearm in WMAs like the Otter Creek recreational area, anyone hunting from a blind must make sure that the blind has hunterâ€™s orange material attached, and it is visible from every side. Also, hunters in the blind must stick to the orange clothing requirement. For WMA or Kentucky public hunting lands where the taking of games like bears, elks, and deer is prohibited, hunters are not allowed to set up hunting blinds or wear orange clothing during the firearm seasons.


### Kentucky Shooting Hours


The shooting hours for most game species in Kentucky are usually during daylight hours, between 30 minutes prior to sunrise and 30 minutes after sunset. Notwithstanding, hunters are allowed to be on hunting fields and stand before the shooting hours. However, there are exceptions to these shooting hours for games like opossums, frogs, coyotes, and raccoons.


Hunters can take opossums and raccoons during the day or at night, with the exception of modern firearm deer hunting season, where you may only take opossums and raccoons at night.


### Prohibited hunting methods


Hunting practices that are illegal in Kentucky include the following:

* It is a prohibition to chase games like turkey, elk, and deer with hunting dogs, or with the aid of a horse while on the horseback. An exception to this prohibition is the use of dogs to locate turkeys during the fall turkey season.
* It is a prohibition to take bears, elks, and deer when they are swimming.
* It is a prohibition to give bears food either directly or indirectly, regardless of the reason for doing so.

This prohibition also covers the baiting of games on Kentucky private hunting lands. Under this law, any area that has been previously baited will still be considered baited until 30 days after the baits are removed.


Baited areas are lands or places where substances that can attract games like grains or feeds have been placed to draw games like turkeys, deer, and bears out.


However, areas where grains or other feed substances exist due to farm practices or growing crops for wildlife management are not prohibited for hunting.
