Hunting in Minnesota

Minnesota Game, Fish, and Wildlife
----------------------------------


The following are some of the most popular game hunts in Minnesota:


### Minnesota is hunting for deer.


Deer hunting is popular in popular Minnesota cities such as Bemidji, Grand Rapids, and Detroit Lakes. They are widely spread throughout the state and are one of the most sought-after games.


### Black bear hunting in Minnesota


Minnesota black bear hunting takes place in the state's forested areas. They also live in swampy, brushy, and sloughy habitats throughout the state. In some Minnesota WMAs, black bears can be hunted by baiting them first before taking them from an elevated stand or blind.


### Hunting for Turkeys in Minnesota


Turkey hunting is popular in Minnesota on several WMAs and public hunting grounds. Turkeys can also be taken on private grounds by hunters who have access to them. You may even take turkeys on private grounds where there are no signs prohibiting hunting.


### Hunting for Bobcats in Minnesota


Bobcat hunting in Minnesota used to be common throughout the state, but it is now only found in the southern portion of the state. They are typically found in forest areas in Minnesota's northern and northeastern counties. In Minnesota, bobcats are an adaptable game that may live on a variety of areas depending on their use.


### Pheasant Hunting in Minnesota


Pheasant hunting in Minnesota occurs on public hunting properties throughout the state. Montevideo, Pipestone, and Marshall counties are excellent starting points for pheasant hunters. These counties have the best pheasant hunting WMAs. In addition, Minnesota WMAs with rivers are ideal for pheasant hunting season.

In the Minnesota Northwest, moose hunting takes place in woodlots and farm fields. However, due to population declines, moose hunting in the state has been halted.


### Hunting for Elk in Minnesota


Elk hunting in Minnesota is primarily concentrated in counties such as Marshall and Kittson in the state's northwest. Because of the presence of three elk herds, the state is well-known for elk hunting in the United States.
