The state also has feral goats and hogs. In addition, Hawaii has many islands with wildlife management zones.


 **Hunting regulations in Hawaii**
----------------------------------


In Hawaii, hunting regulations differ from region to region, and each region is referred to as a hunting unit. Hunting rules, restrictions, and regulations are enforced by the Hawaii Division of Wildlife and Forestry.


Some of the rules you should be aware of before going hunting in Hawaii are as follows:


###  **Regulations for Licenses, Permits, and Tags**


In Hawaii, hunting license rules are as follows:


* Every time a hunter enters a hunting area, they must have a valid Hawaii hunting license or any tags and permits required for the game.

* It is illegal to have hunting weapons and archery equipment in your possession or to discharge a firearm on public hunting grounds if you do not have a valid hunting license or do not own the license.
* You are only permitted to own one rifle or the archery equipment required for the game you wish to hunt. An exemption is provided for a hunter carrying another hunter's firearm to help the person. In addition, hunters must make their hunting equipment available for examination by a representative of the Hawaii Department of Wildlife and Forestry. Any hunter who refuses to comply with this restriction will violate Hawaii hunting law, which may result in the revocation of permits and other hunting privileges.
* When there is a closed season or a no-hunting day, it is illegal to possess archery or firearm equipment on public hunting lands.
