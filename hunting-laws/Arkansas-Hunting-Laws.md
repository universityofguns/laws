Arkansas game hunting


Hunting is a year-round hobby in Arkansas because there is at least one hunting season every month. Some games have an open season throughout the state, while others are only available during specific hunting seasons.


There are several hunting opportunities in the state, with a wide range of species available to both citizens and non-residents.


Arkansas Hunting Laws and Regulations
-------------------------------------


The Arkansas Fish and Game Commission is in charge of enacting the state's hunting rules and regulations. In addition, certain private wildlife management zones have their own hunting laws. The Commission recommends that hunters research the laws and restrictions in the areas where they intend to hunt.


The Arkansas Fish and Game Commission supervises hunting activities in areas owned by them or leased to them for the purpose of taking wildlife. Among the regulations are the following:


* It is illegal to breach any of the commission's signs on the property.
* It is illegal for hunters to leave their own signs on the land.
* It is illegal to demolish any building, structure, or sign built on land owned by the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission.
* You are not permitted to remove crops, fruits, rocks, or other objects from the land. This regulation is exempted for shed deer antlers.
* It is illegal to burn non-combustible objects in the camp created in these areas.
* It is illegal for hunters to burn grass or wood at their campsites.
* You may not ignore a burning fire or allow it to burn uncontrollably.
* Baiting games or wildlife is prohibited. Baits or traps used to attract furbearers are exempt from this law.
* It is illegal to excavate timber or apply inorganic defoliants to trees.
* You are not permitted to build, shelter, or camp on the property.
* It is illegal to abandon any personal belongings or wildlife management zones. The Arkansas Fish and Game Commission makes an exception for cameras and removable stands that are lawfully permitted.
* It is prohibited to operate boats in a negligent and inattentive manner. Violation of this legislation might result in a one-year ban for the culprit.
* Aside from knives designed exclusively for hunting, you are not permitted to use any other cutting equipment.


### Regulation of Automobiles


Motorized vehicles such as amphibious vehicles, terrain vehicles, and so on are not permitted in Wildlife Management Areas. This policy also prohibits motorized vehicles from operating on highways or other wildlife-friendly terrain.


Hunters with mobility-impaired access licenses are permitted to drive ATVs; however, there may be certain limits.


There are, however, some exceptions to this rule for leased wildlife management areas. Among them are the following:


* Bicycles and ATVs are permitted on open roads in WMAs such as Jim Kress and Cherokee. However, while traveling in these cars, hunters must have a current Arkansas license.
* Motorized vehicles are permitted on important highways in WMAs such as the Big Timber Upland Demonstration Areas. However, ATVs are not permitted.
* ATVs are permitted on open road paths in WMAs such as Gum Flats, Lake Greeson, and Casey Jones. However, motorized vehicles are not permitted on state forestry commission-cleared boundary lines.
* ATVs are authorized on designated routes on the Big Timber WMA during open season to allow hunters access to campsites. Except on designated and open highways, ATVs are prohibited.
* Every natural WMA in the state is only accessible by foot.
* Electric bikes are permitted in certain of the state's WMAs.


### Regulations for Hunting Equipment


Traps are not permitted in wildlife management areas except during the open season. Furthermore, weapons and rifles with calibers greater than 22 are only permitted during certain game seasons, such as elk and bear, and during daylight hunting for predators such as bobcats, coyotes, and foxes in the state.


Muzzleloaders are permitted throughout firearm seasons, with the exception of those with calibers greater than.40, which are restricted for WMA. Exceptions are given for muzzleloading and modern guns during hunting seasons for elk, deer, and bears.


Also, during elk, bobcat, coyote, and fox seasons, it is permissible to hunt with weapons in broad daylight. However, there may be exceptions for some wildlife management zones and privately owned hunting lands.


Even if firearms are permitted throughout hunting seasons, they may not be used unless the firearm is lawful for the season at the time.


### Possession of alcohol while hunting


It is illegal to possess any form of alcoholic beverage while hunting in a WMA managed by Arkansas Fish and Game. There is an exception to this rule for:


* Alcohol possession in private inholdings in Arkansas
* Possession of alcohol in vehicles traveling on public roads and following hunting laws
* Possession of alcohol in boats on state water bodies is allowed as long as the operation complies with hunting rules.
* Possession of alcohol on a boat or water vehicle while participating in fishing activities, as long as the operation complies with state rules


### Camping Rules and Regulations


According to the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission, camping while hunting in the state should not last more than two weeks and should take place in a specific location authorized for campgrounds. It is also illegal for any active camp to be unoccupied for more than two days. It is illegal to cause any kind of disturbance within a camp after 10 p.m.


This legislation also forbids using a campsite for more than one month each year. Non-hunters are not required to have a permit while hunting with a licensed hunter in the state. Loaded guns are also prohibited in the state's campgrounds and parking lots.

Arkansas Department of Wildlife, Game, and Fish
-----------------------------------------------


Arkansas has the following wildlife and games available for hunting:


### Arkansas is hunting for deer.


Because approximately 90% of Arkansas' hunting properties are privately held, the sportsmen in charge have a large say in how deer are harvested on their property. However, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has a deer-taking aid program to assist landowners and deer hunters in the state in making the best decisions.


### Hunting for elk in Arkansas


Elk hunting was established in Arkansas in 1998, and hunters' permits are picked at random to hunt elk on public property. Private landowners issue quota-based hunting permits. Hunters who hunt elk on private land are usually required to seek permission from the management.


### Bear hunting in Arkansas


Bears were previously more common and widely spread in Arkansas. However, overhunting and human encroachment resulted in an alarming drop in their population in the early 1990s. However, when the State Game and Fish Commission was established in 1927, severe laws were enacted prohibiting bear hunting, and the figures gradually began to rise again.


### Alligator hunting in Arkansas


Alligators in Arkansas are found in limited numbers throughout the state. The southeast and southwest portions of the state are home to a disproportionate number of alligators. Alligator sport hunting is being practiced in Arkansas.


### Rabbit hunting in Arkansas


Swamp rabbits and cottontail rabbits are the two most frequent rabbit species in Arkansas. They live in densely forested sections of the state, overgrown fence rows, and brush heaps.

### Waterfowl hunting in Arkansas


The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission provides approximately 3,800 acres of land for waterfowl hunting in the state. This is because of the state's Natural Resources and Conservation Service's waterfowl rice incentive.


### Hunting for Doves in Arkansas


Doves are the most common migratory birds in the United States. In Arkansas, three dove species are available: the Eurasian dove, the mourning dove, and the white-winged dove.


### Hunting for Crows in Arkansas


In Arkansas, there are two types of crows to hunt: the fish crow and the American crow. The former live in the state's forested areas, while the latter can be found in various bodies of water, such as rivers and lakes.


### Hunting for ducks in Arkansas


Duck hunting is popular in Arkansas, and the state has several Wildlife Management Areas dedicated to the sport.
