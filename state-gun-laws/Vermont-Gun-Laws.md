### Vermont Gun Law Overview

### Dealer Requirements

  * All dealers must keep records of all sales of new and used handguns. These records must include the weapon‚Äôs make, name, model, caliber, and manufacturer‚Äôs serial number, as well as the purchaser‚Äôs name, address, occupation, age, height, weight, and hair and eye color. The records must be kept on file and on location for at least six years and made available to the proper authorities if requested.

### Zip Guns

  * Zip guns, which can be disguised as other objects, are prohibited and considered illegal in Vermont. This law ensures that while open carry and concealed carry are permitted without a permit, the possession of such disguised weapons is controlled.



### Machine Guns and Automatic Weapons

  * Vermont does not impose regulations on machine guns or automatic weapons as long as they comply with federal laws.
