### Additional Details on Wisconsin Gun Laws

### General Overview

Wisconsin is often grouped with states that do not provide for strict or extremely selective firearm policies. State law does not require an individual to obtain a gun license or permit for the purchase of shotguns, rifles, handguns, or other firearms. Furthermore, there is no permit or gun license required for the possession of a firearm.

### Retailer and Dealer Requirements

All retailers, dealers, manufacturers, pawnbrokers, or businesses that sell firearms are required to keep records of each individual sale and purchase. The records must be kept on-site of the place of business and will be reproduced if a law enforcement official requires that information.

### Handgun Purchase Waiting Period

A 48-hour waiting period is implemented on the purchase of any handgun.

### Machine Guns and Firearm Components

The possession of machine guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and gun silencers and compressors is allowed by state law, as long as they are properly registered with state and federal authorities. Gun dealers may also be authorized to sell these types of firearms and components as long as they are certified by state and federal regulations to do so.

### Concealed Carry

The most notable key piece of legislation that Wisconsin employs is that concealed weapon carry is now legal.

### Open Carry

The open carry of a weapon is legal. The open carry of a weapon while transporting is allowed, as long as the weapon is not loaded and secured in a case.
