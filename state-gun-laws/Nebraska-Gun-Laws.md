### Overview of Nebraska Gun Laws

### General Regulations

Like many states in the Great Plains, Nebraska possesses a weak stance on gun control laws. Nebraska does not require a license or permit to purchase or possess firearms. Registration for both handguns and rifles is not necessary. The only firearm permit mandatory by state law is for carrying and concealment purposes.

### Handgun Purchases

  * Instead of firearm permits at the time of purchase, Nebraska law requires a certificate to validate such an acquisition.
  * A handgun is defined as any firearm with a barrel less than 16 inches long or any firearm designed to be held and used with a single hand.
  * Application for the certificate can be conducted in person at the sheriff‚Äôs office or through the mail.
  * A criminal history check is conducted upon submission of the application. The certificate will be upheld if the applicant is over the age of 21 and is not prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a handgun (applicant must also not be a drug addict or former felon).
  * Once approved, a certificate will be obtained within 3 days. The certificate does not require a safety or weapons training course and only takes 3 days to process as opposed to 30.




### Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP)

  * Nebraska did not require a firearms permit for carrying or concealment until January of 2007.
  * A CHP will be issued and accepted under Nebraska gun law provided that the applicant:
  * Is not prohibited under Federal Law from possessing a firearm.
  * Is a resident of Nebraska.
  * Submits two sets of fingerprints.
  * Passes a series of eye examinations.
  * Pays fees of about $100.
  * Is at least 21 years old and has completed a series of instructional courses that focus on safe firing, handling, proper storage, loading, and techniques for avoiding violent confrontation.
  * A CHP does not allow for weapons to be carried under the consumption of drugs or alcohol or in the following locations: hospitals, courtrooms, establishments with liquor licenses, places of worship, financial institutions, fundraisers, schools, or sporting events.
