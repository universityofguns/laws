### Firearm Laws in Missouri

### General Overview

Missouri gun laws are among the weakest in the country, but this leniency has not led to higher violent crime rates, which can be attributed to the state‚Äôs strong culture supporting the right to carry guns. Here is a quick reference chart for licenses, registrations, and permits, dividing handguns and rifles into two groups:

### Rifles and Shotguns

  * No permit is required to purchase rifles and shotguns.
  * Registration of rifles and shotguns is not required.
  * Ownership licenses are not required.
  * A permit to carry shotguns and rifles is not required.



### Handguns

  * No permit is necessary to purchase a handgun.
  * Registration of handguns is not required.
  * Ownership licenses are not required.
  * The right to carry handguns requires a license.



Licensing of ownership and registration of firearms is not mandatory under Missouri gun law. State permits are also not required for the purchase of handguns or long guns in Missouri. Miscellaneous restrictions, which outline the use of such firearms, are fairly generic according to the interpretation of Missouri gun legislation.

### Possession Regulations

It is a misdemeanor to possess an unloaded firearm under the influence of drugs or alcohol (it is a felony if the weapon is loaded). The only other regulation regarding possession under Missouri gun law is that it is unlawful for a felon (five years from imprisonment), fugitive, or habitual drug user to possess a concealable firearm. Like many states in the Midwest and Deep South, Missouri gun law is very loose and has very little regulation.



### Concealed Carry Regulations

The right to carry guns in Missouri is a little more rigorous. It is illegal to carry a concealed handgun without a concealed carry endorsement, which is labeled on the Missouri driver‚Äôs license.

To obtain a carry endorsement, the applicant must be at least 23 years of age, a citizen of the United States, and reside in Missouri for a minimum of six months. Applications to legally carry and conceal a firearm are submitted to the sheriff of the county of residence. The application includes basic information, state and federal background checks, fingerprinting, and proof of weapons training completion.

Once all documentation is filed, the sheriff has three days to issue the certificate of qualification for a concealed carry endorsement. In addition to the endorsement, any state concealment permit will be upheld by Missouri gun laws ‚Äî the right to carry guns will be considered legal if any concealment permit is shown to law enforcement. Once obtained, the endorsement is valid for three years.

### Restrictions on Carrying Firearms

The right to carry guns, whether concealed or not, is always considered unlawful in airports, hospitals, schools, churches, bars or restaurants, and sporting events. Like most states, Missouri gun law is lax in regard to purchase, ownership, and registration, but strict when it comes to concealment.
