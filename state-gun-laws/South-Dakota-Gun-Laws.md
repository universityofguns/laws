### General Overview of South Dakota Gun Laws

South Dakota is considered to have some of the least restrictive gun policies in the nation. The state does not require a permit to acquire a shotgun, rifle, or handgun.

Additionally, firearm owners are not required to be licensed or to register their weapons. The minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm is 18, and minors under this age may possess a handgun with proper permission from a parent or legal guardian. While no application process is needed for purchasing rifles or shotguns, an application is required for handguns purchased from federally licensed firearms dealers. This process includes a 48-hour waiting period before acquiring the handgun. The dealer must submit the application to the local police chief or sheriff within six hours of the transaction, serving as a record for future reference.

State law prohibits individuals with a history of violent crimes, felony charges, or misdemeanor domestic violence charges from possessing firearms. However, individuals with such a history can petition the court to restore their right to bear arms after one year. The court will consider restoration pending an evaluation of the individual, even though their civil rights can legally be restored after that period.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed handguns require a permit in South Dakota. Eligible individuals must meet state possession requirements and additional criteria, including:

  * Being a U.S. citizen
  * Being a South Dakota resident for at least 30 days
  * Not being considered a danger to others or self in the past ten years
  * Having no history of alcohol, drug, or controlled substance abuse
  * Having no felony or misdemeanor convictions related to firearms or substances in the past five years



Permits are issued by the sheriff contingent on the applicant‚Äôs background check. Approved applicants may receive a temporary license within five days of application. Permits do not allow concealed weapons in establishments generating over 50% of sales from alcohol, public facilities such as schools, police stations, and courthouses. Transporting a handgun does not require a permit if it is unloaded and secured in the trunk or a case that cannot be concealed on the person.



### Controlled Weapons

South Dakota has special laws regarding ‚Äúcontrolled weapons,‚Äù including machine guns, short-barreled shotguns, and silencers. Possession of these firearms is illegal unless the individual is a law enforcement officer or a member of the armed forces on duty. Controlled weapons kept for display must be inoperable and registered with the State Law Enforcement Division.
