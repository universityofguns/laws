### General Overview of Tennessee Gun Laws

Tennessee gun control laws are considered to be some of the least restrictive in the United States. No permit is required to purchase a firearm per the state’s gun control laws. Any person aged over 18 years is eligible to purchase a firearm, as long it is classified as a shotgun or rifle.

A minor may acquire a firearm on the basis that the weapon is given on loan under permission by an adult, and for the purposes of hunting, camping, or other legal sporting activity involving firearms. However, as per gun purchasing laws referring to the acquisition of a handgun, the purchaser must be subject to approval pending a criminal history background check conducted by the Bureau of Investigation of the state, and administered by the licensed dealer at the time of the handgun purchase.

Furthermore, the licensed dealer must include the purchaser’s pertinent information, as well as the weapon’s make, model, caliber, and manufacturer’s number, which are necessary to complete the background check. If the applicant is void of any criminal history that disqualifies them from being able to make the handgun purchase, the bureau issues the dealer a special approval number, and the buyer is responsible for a fee of up to ten dollars for the background check itself. A background check is not necessary for any transactions between dealers and manufacturers, or between dealers and members of law enforcement.



### Gun Possession Laws

Tennessee gun control laws allow for the possession of firearms without a permit. Those immediately disqualified from possession are convicted felons involving crimes of a violent nature or drugs. Handguns are also restricted to adults over the age of 18 years unless the minor possesses such a weapon for the purpose of hunting and other sports; this includes practicing at an authorized location, attending a safety or instruction course, or if found in a justified situation to use deadly force for the preservation of themselves or others.
