### Gun Control: A Balancing Act in North Carolina

Gun control remains a highly debated topic, whether at the state legislature or in Congress. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, along with most state constitutions, protects the right of citizens to own and bear arms. However, gun violence challenges both state and federal governments to find practical ways to address public safety.

### Federal Firearms Law

Although most gun regulation occurs at the state level, some key federal gun laws apply nationwide. Federal law governs the ownership and registration of certain dangerous weapons and accessories, such as machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, sawed-off rifles, and silencers. It also sets licensing requirements for firearms dealers.

Federal law bans the possession or ownership of guns by convicted felons and those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. These prohibitions form the basis for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), used by federally licensed firearms dealers and most law enforcement agencies to help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.

### North Carolina Gun Control Laws

North Carolinaâ€™s gun control laws seek to balance the rights of gun owners with the stateâ€™s duty to keep people safe. The state does not regulate or reduce access to assault weapons, and in 2023, it repealed its pistol purchase permit law. Here are some key aspects of North Carolinaâ€™s gun laws:

#### Background Checks on Gun Purchases

In several states, there is momentum to require universal background checks for gun purchases. Anyone buying a gun through a federally licensed dealer must pass a background check. However, federal law does not cover private sales or transfers. North Carolina had previously closed the background check loophole for handgun purchases by requiring a permit to purchase a handgun, but this law was repealed in 2023.

#### License and Carry Laws

North Carolina generally prohibits carrying concealed firearms, with exceptions for members of the U.S. Armed Forces and certain law enforcement officers. Individuals can apply for a concealed carry permit (CHP) at their local sheriffâ€™s office, which requires a criminal background check.

Regardless of having a CHP, carrying a firearm while consuming alcohol or under the influence of a controlled substance is prohibited. Additionally, there are several locations where carrying firearms is restricted, including:

  * Schools and educational facilities
  * Law enforcement and correctional facilities
  * Government buildings
  * Places where a fee is charged for entry
  * Establishments where alcohol is sold and consumed
  * State Capitol Building and grounds
  * Executive Mansion and the Western Residence of the Governor
  * Court buildings
  * Parades, funeral processions, picket lines, and certain demonstrations
  * Private property with posted firearm prohibition



CHP holders can carry concealed handguns in state parks and highway rest areas.

#### State Preemption Statute

North Carolina has a state preemption statute limiting local governments from passing ordinances conflicting with state gun laws. However, local authorities can regulate the discharge of firearms, display of guns on public property, and the carrying of concealed handguns on certain municipal and county properties.
