### Maine Gun Laws

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people the right to bear arms. Maine’s constitution also recognizes gun rights, stating, “Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms, and this right shall never be questioned.” However, the right to bear arms is not absolute. The challenge for federal and state governments is to balance concerns for public safety with the right to own guns.

On Oct. 25, 2023, a mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, brought renewed attention to the state’s gun laws. A gunman opened fire in a bowling alley and a restaurant, killing 18 people and injuring 13 others. After a two-day chase, authorities found the suspect, an Army reservist, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. This incident has led Maine’s governor to call on the Maine legislature to tighten the state’s gun restrictions, particularly in the areas of background checks and mental health. Whether Maine enacts new legislation in the aftermath of the shooting remains to be seen. Lawmakers often disagree on what changes to firearm laws will help prevent gun violence.

### Federal Firearms Laws

While constitutional provisions take precedence, federal and state firearms laws continue to develop and change. Federal laws provide a structure to regulate the legal manufacture, use, sale, and possession of firearms. The National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) regulated certain dangerous weapons, including short-barreled rifles and shotguns, silencers, and machine guns. It requires the registration of these weapons and others. The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) expanded the categories of persons barred from having or owning firearms. Bans extend to people with felony convictions and misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence, those who are subject to protection orders, and more. Under the GCA, the government will run a background check when a person tries to buy a firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer to prevent gun purchases by those prohibited under the law.

### Maine’s Gun Laws

### Gun Ownership and Safety

Maine’s gun laws focus more on gun ownership than on gun safety. As a mostly rural state, Maine emphasizes safety related to hunting and recreational target shooting. Gun control advocates recommend that Maine pass laws supporting universal background checks for gun purchases and consider a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

### Permitless Carry Law

In 2015, Maine enacted a “permitless carry” law, allowing people 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Gun control advocates see these laws as dangerous, as they can lead to people carrying a firearm with little experience or bad intentions. With permit or license laws, the public can take comfort in knowing that carriers had to complete firearms training and pass a background check before carrying concealed weapons. The State of Maine still has a concealed carry permit law, allowing Maine residents to get reciprocity from other states. The Maine State Police, local police chiefs, or sheriffs can issue permits.

### Preemption Statute

Maine enacted a preemption statute that prevents local municipalities from passing firearms regulations in most areas. One exception is that local jurisdictions can regulate the discharge of firearms within their boundaries.

### Firearms in Motor Vehicles

Maine law generally allows people over 21 who are not banned from having a firearm to possess firearms in motor vehicles. Those 18–20 years old who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, the National Guard, or a law enforcement agency typically qualify for an exception. Employers can’t ban employees who have a concealed handgun permit from having firearms in their locked vehicles as long as the firearm is not visible.

### Firearm-Free Zones

  * Labor disputes and strikes



### Firearm Safety Requirements for Dealers

Although Maine does not require a firearm permit, it mandates that every firearm dealer in the state offer a firearm safety brochure with each sale. Dealers must post information related to local, voluntary firearms safety programs and offer to show buyers how to use a trigger-locking device.
