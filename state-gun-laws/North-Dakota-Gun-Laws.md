### North Dakota Gun Control Laws: An Overview

North Dakota ranks as one of the safest states in the country based on violent crime statistics, with just two firearm-related murders in 2009. Despite this, North Dakotaâ€™s gun control laws are among the most relaxed in the United States. Here are the basic regulations for the purchase, possession, and concealment of firearms:

### Carrying and Possessing Loaded Firearms

North Dakota imposes specific provisions on carrying and possessing loaded firearms. It is generally illegal to carry a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle unless specific conditions are met, such as having a concealed weapons permit or being in a security enforcement vehicle.

Carrying an unloaded handgun is permitted one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset, provided it is in plain sight. Concealed carry of a loaded firearm requires completion of an application process.

### Obtaining a Concealed Carry Permit

While North Dakotaâ€™s gun control laws are lenient overall, obtaining a permit for concealed carry involves a rigorous process. The application is overseen by the chief of the bureau of criminal investigation and requires:

  * Demonstrating a valid reason for carrying a concealed firearm
  * Compliance with federal firearm possession laws
  * Written approval from the chief of police and sheriff of the applicantâ€™s county
  * Satisfactory completion of a background check and criminal records check
  * Passing an open book test on firearm safety and demonstrating competency in handling firearms, including loading, unloading, and using safety devices




### Gun Shows and Firearm Distribution

Despite the strictness in obtaining a concealed carry permit, North Dakotaâ€™s regulations on gun shows and firearm distribution are notably relaxed. Sales at gun shows do not require licenses, permits, or background checks. Distributors are not obligated to document sales or comply with state filings. There are no police inspections or security checks at these events, and no restrictions on bulk purchases, magazine sizes, or ammunition sales.
