### Balancing Gun Control and Gun Rights

As the national debate regarding gun control and the rights of gun owners shows no signs of cooling down, states must strike their own balance in their gun laws and regulations. State legislators often seek to respond to incidences of gun violence but must assess what role the law can play to improve gun safety.

### Federal and State Regulation

The Second Amendment permits individuals to keep and bear arms, but states can outlaw certain weapons and accessories. They can also establish licenses and permits for the purchase of firearms and the carrying of concealed firearms in public.

The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 (as amended) sets forth a baseline of federal laws related to interstate commerce in firearms. It includes a licensing and regulation scheme for those who manufacture, produce, and sell guns. Federal law prohibits the possession or ownership of firearms by persons with felony convictions, misdemeanor domestic violence convictions, mental illness impairments, or substance abuse issues. Federal firearms dealers must also conduct a background check on all gun purchases through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

### Iowa Gun Laws

### Permitless Carry and Optional Permits (2021)

In 2021, Iowa enacted new laws that included a ‚Äúpermitless carry‚Äù law and made the permit application to acquire a firearm optional. Gun sales between private individuals no longer require a background check. The permitless carry law allows law-abiding individuals to carry a loaded firearm on their person, either openly or concealed, in public.

### Restricted Locations for Firearms

Iowa law prohibits the presence of firearms in certain public places:

  * Within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary or secondary school or park (weapons-free zones)
  * School buses
  * Casinos



Federal law also restricts firearms in these locations:

  * Post offices and their parking lots
  * Federal facilities
  * IRS offices
  * Federal courthouses
  * Airports (secure areas)
  * Ranger stations
  * Federal buildings in federal parks



The status of gun bans in sensitive areas has become volatile since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022). This ruling affirmed the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to carry arms for self-defense in public. The Court held that regulations burdening the right to bear arms must be reviewed case by case, and the government must show that the regulation in question aligns with traditional, historical firearms regulation in the U.S.

### State Constitutional Amendment (2022)

In 2022, Iowans passed a state constitutional amendment stating:

‚ÄúThe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The sovereign state of Iowa affirms and recognizes this right to be a fundamental individual right. Any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.‚Äù

### Permitting Process

The Iowa Department of Public Safety oversees a permitting process to aid in reciprocity with other states. An individual may complete a permit application available at the sheriff‚Äôs office of their county of residence. Iowa permits include:

  * Permit to acquire a pistol or revolver
  * Nonprofessional carry weapons permit
  * Professional carry weapons permit



### Age Requirements

Iowans can purchase long guns (rifles and shotguns) once they are 18 years old. To purchase or possess a handgun (pistol or revolver) or get a carry weapons permit, a resident must be 21 years old. Certain exceptions apply for persons 18‚Äì20 who are on duty as a peace officer, security guard, correctional officer, or member of the military.

### Training Requirements

Nonprofessional carry permit applicants must show they have met state-issued training requirements, which may include completion of a training course through the National Rifle Association (NRA) or other organizations approved by the Department of Public Safety. Professional carry permits are issued to law enforcement officers, private investigators, or security guards, justifying the need to be armed.

### No Waiting Period

Iowa imposes no waiting period for gun purchases. Buyers must be of legal age and not fall under legal prohibitions for possession, such as having a felony conviction.

### Prohibited Firearms

Iowa does not ban assault weapons, but some firearms are illegal, including:

  * Machine guns (with limited exceptions for law enforcement and the military)
  * Short-barreled shotguns
  * Short-barreled rifles
  * Suppressors (silencers) if not compliant with federal law



### Prohibited Ownership

Individuals cannot own firearms if they:

  * Have a felony conviction
  * Are adjudicated delinquent for a crime that would be a felony if committed by an adult
  * Are under 21 years old (with exceptions)
  * Have a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction or are subject to a domestic violence protective order




### Concealed Carry and Open Carry

A concealed carry license is not required if a person is not otherwise disqualified under state or federal law. Open carry is allowed, except for pistols or revolvers in the state capitol building and grounds or other prohibited locations.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

To obtain a nonprofessional permit to carry weapons, applicants must:

  * Be 21 years of age or older
  * Complete and sign an application form and display a proper identification card, such as a driver‚Äôs license
  * Show no probable cause that they will use the weapon unlawfully
  * Not be addicted to alcohol
  * Have no felony conviction
  * Have not been convicted of any aggravated misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor under Chapter 708 (Assault) in the last three years
  * Complete approved firearm safety training
  * Not be otherwise prohibited from owning a firearm under Iowa or federal laws



### Penalties for Illegal Firearm Possession

Unauthorized possession of offensive weapons, suppressors, short-barreled shotguns, or short-barreled rifles is a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $10,245. Possession of a firearm by a person with a felony or a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction, or while under a domestic violence protective order, is also a Class D felony. Possession of a loaded firearm by a minor is a serious misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $2,560. Making a false statement on an application for a permit to carry weapons is a Class D felony.

### Penalties for Illegal Possession on or Near School Grounds

Carrying a firearm on or near school grounds is a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $10,245.
