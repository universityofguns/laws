### Pennsylvania Gun Statutes

Pennsylvania has relatively stringent gun laws compared to other states. The Pennsylvania General Assembly, which is politically divided with Republicans controlling the State Senate and Democrats controlling the State House, often experiences a political stalemate on gun control. State law maintains several regulations aimed at balancing the right to firearm ownership with laws that combat gun violence.

### Gun Purchase Regulations

Pennsylvania gun laws require a purchase application for all handguns bought in the state. All handgun purchases must go through a dealer for a criminal background check via the Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS). Sales of handguns, sawed-off shotguns, and sawed-off rifles must be conducted through a licensed dealer or a county sheriffâ€™s office.

While these laws bring Pennsylvania closer to universal background checks for all gun purchases, private sales of standard long guns (rifles and shotguns) fall outside these regulations. Pennsylvania does not require a waiting period before purchasing a gun, nor does it have an assault weapon ban. State law also outlines categories of persons prohibited from possessing a firearm, making it a felony to provide or deliver a gun to a prohibited person.

With limited exceptions for hunting or activities involving adult supervision, minors (under 18 years of age) cannot possess or carry a firearm in the state. Providing a gun to a minor can result in felony charges. Selling or leasing any deadly weapon, cartridge, or gunpowder to a minor is also a crime.

### License to Carry Firearms

In Pennsylvania, anyone 21 years or older can apply for a license to carry firearms. Without such a license, it is a crime to carry a firearm concealed or to have one in a motor vehicle. Exceptions include carrying a firearm at your residence or place of business and for those with a sportsmenâ€™s firearm permit.

Applications for a license to carry (LTC) permit are processed through the county sheriffâ€™s office using a uniform application form prescribed by the Pennsylvania State Police. Details on eligibility requirements are outlined in the relevant state laws. The Pennsylvania attorney general provides information on reciprocity agreements with other states, allowing non-residents with firearm permits from their home states to legally carry in Pennsylvania.

Unlike some states, Pennsylvania does not require an applicant to complete a firearms training course before qualifying for a carry permit. Although the application can be obtained online, applicants must appear in person at the sheriffâ€™s office for signature and photograph.

### Location Restrictions

Pennsylvania law prohibits carrying firearms into certain locations, even for those with an LTC permit. These places include:

  * Courts and court facilities
  * State Capitol building
  * Elementary and secondary school buildings and grounds
  * Colleges and universities
  * Private property with posted signs prohibiting firearms



Exceptions apply to members of law enforcement.

### Second Amendment Challenges

In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen that the Second Amendment provides a right to carry a gun in public for self-defense. As a result, gun laws that burden gun rights must meet a historical test for firearm regulation. This has led to recent challenges to Pennsylvania gun laws with mixed success.

For instance, in Lara v. Commissioner (2024), the federal Third Circuit Court of Appeals found a Pennsylvania law that banned persons 18 to 20 years of age from carrying a firearm during a public emergency violated the Second Amendment. In Range v. Attorney General (2023), the Third Circuit invalidated Pennsylvaniaâ€™s felon-in-possession statute for a person convicted of a food stamp fraud offense.

In contrast, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld a township ordinance that placed discharge and zoning requirements on indoor and outdoor gun ranges on private property in Barris v. Stroud Township (2024). The court found the ordinances consistent with traditional firearm regulations from the nationâ€™s founding to the present day.
