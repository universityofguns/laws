### Alaska Gun Ownership Regulations

Alaska gun laws do not require registration or a permit to purchase or carry rifles, shotguns, and handguns. Although Alaska gun laws are still subject to federal gun laws, they also maintain their own unique provisions and guidelines.

### Purchase Requirements

  * The main requirement to purchase a firearm in Alaska is that the individual must be at least 18 years of age.
  * It is illegal to sell or transfer any firearm to people who have been found guilty of committing a felony. This statute also includes any individual who was tried as a minor but would have resulted in a felony if tried as an adult.
  * If an individual was found guilty of a felony, they may become eligible to purchase a firearm after ten years have passed since the date of sentencing.
  * It is illegal to sell a firearm to any person who may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs or has a mental condition that would prohibit the use of a firearm.
