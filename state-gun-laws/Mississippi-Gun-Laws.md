### Firearm Laws in Mississippi

### General Overview

Mississippi’s gun laws are lenient, often resulting in high rates of firearm-related crimes. With 12 murders by firearms per 100,000 residents, Mississippi ranks third highest in the nation for this statistic. According to the Brady scorecard, which ranks states’ gun control laws, Mississippi scored a mere 6 out of 100.

### Regulations for Firearms

In Mississippi, no permit is required to purchase handguns or long guns, and neither registration nor licensing is mandated for these firearms. However, carrying a handgun involves more regulations. A permit is not required to carry a rifle, but it can be disallowed in specified areas such as schools, places of worship, or government buildings.



### Restrictions on Possession

Restrictions on firearm possession apply mainly to former convicts. Unless pardoned, a convicted felon cannot lawfully carry a gun. However, a former convict can possess a gun if granted a rehabilitation certificate by the court where they were sentenced. If rehabilitation can be proved following jail time, gun possession rights may be restored.

### Concealed Carry Regulations

Carrying a concealed pistol in Mississippi involves specific regulations. It is legal for anyone over 18 to carry a concealed firearm in their home or place of business and during sporting events that require a firearm. In other instances, a license is required. The application process for a concealed carry permit includes a 120-day waiting period, and applicants must be at least 21 years old, live in Mississippi for a minimum of 12 months, possess a clean criminal background, and show no signs of mental instability. Applicants must submit fingerprints, a full-face photograph, and a fee of approximately $100. If granted, the license is valid for four years and does not authorize carrying a gun in schools, places of worship, athletic events, parades, or public parks.
