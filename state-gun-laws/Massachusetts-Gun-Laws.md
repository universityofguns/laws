### Firearm Laws in Massachusetts

Comparatively speaking, gun control in Massachusetts is among the most comprehensive and strict. Percentage-wise (population divided by murders), violent crimes in Massachusetts are among the lowest in the nation. Similar to Maryland, Massachusetts gun laws are strong regarding permits and restrictions on dealers, but lack comprehensive background checks for prospective purchasers. The permit and license requirements are incredibly complex and must be analyzed in depth.

Gun control in Massachusetts is strong because of the requirements necessary to purchase a license and permit. Fingerprinting, safety training, testing, waiting periods, and law enforcement are involved in the process of obtaining a permit. Permits are required to both purchase and carry all classes of firearms in the state. Procedures revolving around licenses are much more complex.

### Types of Licenses

There are a total of five licenses one can receive in Massachusetts:

  * **RFID (Restricted License)** : Only permits the individual to carry mace or pepper spray.
  * **FID (Firearms Identification Card)** : Allows only long rifles, mace, and pepper spray.
  * **Class B License** : Permits the purchase of long rifles and handguns with small chambers (no more than 10 rounds). Concealment of weapons is not allowed with a Class B license.
  * **Class A License** : Allows an individual to purchase any legal firearm in the state of Massachusetts with concealment privileges granted.
  * **Automatic Weapons License** : Issued only to law enforcement personnel.



A license of ownership must be present at the time of application or purchase. Class A and B carrying licenses take 30 days to process and require the individual to be at least 21 years of age. All weapons and firearms licenses require applications, fees, interviews, and fingerprints to be conducted at the jurisdiction‚Äôs local police department. The integration of law enforcement in the license process makes Massachusetts gun control unique and rigorous.



### Regulations for Gun Dealers

Massachusetts gun laws are perhaps most rigorous for gun dealers. To curb firearm trafficking and the sale of illegal firearms, the state has adopted the harshest laws for gun stores in the nation. The stricter the laws are for the supplier, the harder it is for the buyer to purchase. A simple equation, a dealer must be licensed, keep records, communicate with the state, allow police inspections, and follow numerous security precautions to be considered a legally licensed dealer.
