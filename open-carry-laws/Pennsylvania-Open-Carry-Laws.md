### Overview of Pennsylvania Gun Laws

Pennsylvaniaâ€™s approach to gun regulation reflects a balancing act between ensuring public safety and respecting the rights of gun owners.

### Context and Federal Landscape

Despite frequent proposals, new federal gun laws are rare due to political gridlock. Federal regulations control licensing for firearms dealers and restrict ownership of certain weapons, including machine guns and bump stocks.

### Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Legislative Landscape

Pennsylvania has relatively stringent gun laws compared to other states, shaped by a politically divided General Assembly. These laws aim to address gun violence while respecting Second Amendment rights.

### Regulation of Firearm Purchases

All handgun purchases in Pennsylvania require a completed application and background check through the Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS). Handgun sales must go through licensed dealers or county sheriff offices, bringing the state closer to universal background checks.

### Key Provisions

Pennsylvania does not mandate a waiting period for gun purchases and does not have an assault weapons ban. Certain individuals are prohibited from firearm possession, and it is illegal to provide firearms to minors or prohibited persons.

### License to Carry Firearms (LTC)

Individuals aged 21 and older can apply for an LTC permit in Pennsylvania to carry firearms concealed, except at home or in their place of business. The application process involves the county sheriffâ€™s office and does not require firearms training for eligibility.

### Location Restrictions

Firearms are prohibited in locations such as courts, state Capitol buildings, schools, universities, and private properties with posted signs, except for law enforcement personnel.

### Legal Challenges and Second Amendment Interpretations

Recent court decisions, like in Lara v. Commissioner and Range v. Attorney General, have scrutinized Pennsylvaniaâ€™s gun laws under the Second Amendment, emphasizing historical tests for firearm regulations.
