### Overview of South Carolina Gun Laws

South Carolina navigates a complex landscape of gun rights and regulations, influenced by federal oversight and state-specific legislation.

### Legislative Response to Gun Violence

Following tragic events like the Charleston church shooting in 2015, South Carolina legislators periodically review gun laws to balance public safety with Second Amendment rights.

### Federal and State Regulation

Federal law regulates firearms ownership, including restrictions on dangerous weapons and prohibiting certain individuals from gun possession. States like South Carolina enact additional laws governing gun purchase, possession, and use.

### Second Amendment Interpretation

Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions affirm an individualâ€™s right to own firearms for self-defense. This legal backdrop shapes ongoing challenges to state and federal gun regulations.

### South Carolinaâ€™s Regulatory Framework

South Carolina does not require a permit to purchase or own a firearm and imposes no waiting period for buyers. However, the state prohibits certain categories of individuals from gun ownership.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Currently, South Carolina requires a Concealed Weapons Permit (CWP) for concealed carry in most situations, with exemptions for specific activities like hunting or property protection.

### Proposed Changes

In 2024, South Carolina legislators are considering permitless carry laws, allowing concealed carry without a CWP and background check, based on individual responsibility and adherence to state law.

### Restricted Carry Zones

South Carolina restricts firearms in locations such as schools, government buildings, and places of worship unless express permission is granted.

### Motor Vehicle Regulations

Carrying handguns in vehicles is regulated, with exceptions for licensed hunters and specific transport conditions.

### Legal Penalties

Violations of South Carolinaâ€™s gun laws carry penalties ranging from misdemeanors for unlawful carrying to felonies for possession of prohibited firearms or ammunition.
