Rifles and shotguns are subject to a holding period of twenty-four hours, while handguns have a waiting period of seventy-two hours for actual delivery. This waiting period does not apply to law enforcement officers, authorized dealers, or non-residents at a gun show approved by the Illinois Department of State Police.

### Record Keeping

Dealers are required to retain records of a sale for ten years, including the firearm’s description and serial number, and the buyer’s identification information and FOID number. All purchases are contingent upon a background check, including firearm transfers conducted at gun shows. The minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm in Illinois is eighteen.
