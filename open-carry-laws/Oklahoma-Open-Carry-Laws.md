### State Regulations

Oklahoma is known for its gun-friendly laws, prioritizing the rights of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms. While the state has not enacted new regulations to address rising firearm violence, it has expanded gun rights in recent years.

### Purchase and Possession

  * **No License Requirement** : You do not need a license or permit to purchase a gun in Oklahoma. There is no waiting period after purchase.
  * **Background Checks** : Federal law mandates background checks for purchases from licensed dealers. Private sales do not require background checks.
  * **Prohibited Weapons** : Oklahoma bans possession of sawed-off shotguns, sawed-off rifles, and restricted bullets that penetrate body armor.



### Restrictions on Ownership

  * **Prohibited Persons** : It is illegal to possess firearms if convicted of a felony, adjudicated as mentally incompetent, or illegally in the U.S. Noncitizens and minors under 18 generally cannot possess firearms.

Firearms are generally prohibited in:

  * Government buildings
  * Courthouses
  * Prisons

### Stand Your Ground and Castle Doctrine
