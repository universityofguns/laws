### Purchasing Firearms

Hawaii gun law, unlike many states in the United States, requires any person wishing to purchase or obtain a firearm to apply for a Hawaii gun permit that allows the transaction of firearms. The Hawaii gun permit to purchase extends to shotguns, rifles, and handguns. An individual must first apply for the permit to the chief of police pertaining to the county where the applicant resides or their place of business is located. The applicant must be at least 21 years of age and a citizen of the United States.

There is a fourteen-day waiting period for the Hawaii gun permit to purchase firearms after the application is submitted. The permits themselves are delegated with specific restrictions depending on the type of firearm being purchased or transferred. In the case of rifles or shotguns, a permit is valid for a period of one year, and the permit holder can make subsequent purchases of shotguns or rifles within that time period. In the case of handguns, a separate application and permit are required for each purchase.
