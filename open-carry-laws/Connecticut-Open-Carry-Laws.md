### Firearm Registration and Records

Connecticut requires the registration of certain types of firearms. While the majority of firearms are exempt, all weapons classified as assault weapons must be registered with the state. However, no permit is required for purchasing firearms, except for handguns.

### Eligibility for Firearm Purchase

To be eligible to purchase a firearm in Connecticut, a person must be at least 21 years old, deemed capable of handling a firearm safely as per federal statutes, and possess a handgun eligibility certificate if seeking to purchase handguns. This certificate must be issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety, and there is a two-week waiting period from the date the application is submitted.

Once the application is approved, the certificate is issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety pending receipt of a background check from the FBI. The handgun eligibility certificate is then issued to the prospective firearms purchaser within 60 days of the commissioner receiving the FBI background check. The certificate is valid for up to five years from the day it is issued.
