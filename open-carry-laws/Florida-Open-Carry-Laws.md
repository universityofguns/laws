### Purchasing Firearms

Florida gun laws do not require the registration of shotguns, rifles, or handguns, and there is no permit required to purchase firearms. Individuals must be at least 18 years of age to purchase long guns and 21 years of age to purchase handguns. It is illegal for a minor to purchase or possess a firearm, except with parental or guardian permission. This provision also applies to air guns and BB guns; the only weapon that may be sold to a minor is an ordinary pocket knife. Minors may possess a weapon only while engaged in legal sporting, hunting, and recreational activities under supervision, or at their place of residence with the firearm unloaded.
