Individuals must be at least 18 years of age to purchase long guns and 21 years of age to purchase handguns. It is illegal for a minor to purchase or possess a firearm, except with parental or guardian permission. This provision also applies to air guns and BB guns; the only weapon that may be sold to a minor is an ordinary pocket knife. Minors may possess a weapon only while engaged in legal sporting, hunting, and recreational activities under supervision, or at their place of residence with the firearm unloaded.
