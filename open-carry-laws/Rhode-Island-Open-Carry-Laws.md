### Legislative Changes

In 2022, Rhode Island enacted new gun control laws, including bans on large capacity feeding devices, open carry of loaded shotguns and rifles on public roadways, and raising the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21.

### Federal Regulation

Federal law, overseen by the ATF, sets minimal standards for firearms transactions and prohibits certain individuals from owning firearms. States play a significant role in regulating firearms, including concealed and open carry, waiting periods, and possession in public spaces.

### Second Amendment and Recent Legal Developments

Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, like New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), emphasize individual rights to bear arms for self-defense. This has influenced challenges to state and local gun regulations based on historical firearm regulation standards.

### Rhode Island Gun Control Laws Overview

Rhode Island requires a safety certificate from the Department of Environmental Management to purchase handguns and mandates universal background checks for all firearm transfers. It does not have an assault weapons ban but restricts certain firearms and accessories.

### Licensing Requirements

Rhode Island issues licenses for concealed carry through local authorities or the Attorney Generalâ€™s office, requiring applicants to demonstrate eligibility and need. Open carry without a license is limited to specific circumstances.
