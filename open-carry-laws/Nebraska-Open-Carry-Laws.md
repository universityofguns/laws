### Nebraska Open Carry Laws

Federal and state gun laws in the United States cover a wide range of aspects concerning the sale, purchase, possession, and use of firearms. While federal laws change infrequently, state laws can vary significantly and are subject to more frequent updates. These laws often dictate who can purchase firearms, establish procedures for background checks and waiting periods, and define the legality of concealed and open carry.

### Constitutional Context

The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens the right to bear arms for traditional purposes such as self-defense. This constitutional protection has led to legal challenges against state and local laws that restrict firearm possession or use. A notable recent case, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), underscored the right of individuals to carry firearms in public for self-defense purposes, requiring state regulations to use objective criteria in issuing permits.

### Impact of the Bruen Decision

Following the Bruen decision, state and local governments across the country, including Nebraska, have been prompted to consider constitutional carry laws. These laws allow individuals to carry firearms in public without a permit, whether concealed or openly carried, for self-defense purposes.

### Concealed Carry Laws in Nebraska

In Nebraska, individuals aged 21 and older, who are not otherwise prohibited, can carry a concealed handgun with or without a concealed handgun permit. Certain premises open to the public can restrict concealed carry by posting signs, and specific locations like police stations, courts, and schools are off-limits for concealed carry.

### Background Checks and Waiting Periods

Nebraska requires background checks for handgun purchases through licensed dealers or private sales, with exceptions for certain transactions. There is no state-mandated waiting period for firearm purchases in Nebraska.
