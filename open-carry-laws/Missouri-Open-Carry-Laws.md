### General Overview of Missouri Gun Laws

Missouri gun laws are among the weakest in the country, but such leniency has not significantly affected the state‚Äôs violent crime statistics. This contrast can be attributed to the state‚Äôs cultural emphasis on the right to carry guns. To illustrate this attitude toward gun control, here is a quick reference chart on licenses, registrations, and permits. For clarity, handguns and rifles are divided into two groups.

### Rifles and Shotguns

  * No permit is required to purchase rifles and shotguns.
  * Registration of rifles and shotguns is not required under Missouri gun law.
  * Ownership licenses are not required.
  * A permit to carry shotguns and rifles is not required.



### Handguns

  * No permit is necessary to purchase a handgun.
  * Registration of handguns is not required.
  * Ownership licenses are not required.
  * The right to carry handguns requires a license.



### Licensing and Registration Requirements

Licenses of ownership and registration of firearms are not mandatory under Missouri gun law. State permits are also not required for the purchase of handguns or long guns in Missouri. Miscellaneous restrictions regarding the use of such firearms are fairly generic according to Missouri gun legislation.

### Possession Regulations

  * It is a misdemeanor to possess an unloaded firearm under the influence of drugs or alcohol (it is a felony if the weapon is loaded).
  * The only other regulation regarding possession under Missouri gun law is that it is unlawful for a felon (within five years from imprisonment), fugitive, or habitual drug user to possess a concealable firearm. Like many states in the Midwest and Deep South, Missouri gun law is very loose and has minimal regulation.
