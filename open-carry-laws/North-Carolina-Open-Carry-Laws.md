### North Carolina Open Carry Laws

Gun control remains a contentious issue at both state legislatures and in Congress, balancing Second Amendment rights with public safety concerns. North Carolinaâ€™s gun laws reflect this delicate balance, aiming to uphold gun ownersâ€™ rights while ensuring public safety.

### Federal Firearms Law

While most gun regulation occurs at the state level, federal laws govern ownership and registration of specific firearms like machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, rifles, and silencers. These laws also mandate licensing requirements for firearms dealers and prohibit gun ownership by convicted felons and individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence.

### North Carolina Gun Control Laws

North Carolinaâ€™s laws can exceed federal regulations in restricting firearms. The stateâ€™s laws are perceived as less restrictive compared to others, notably not regulating access to assault weapons and recently repealing its pistol purchase permit law in 2023.

### Background Checks on Gun Purchases

Although federal law mandates background checks for purchases from licensed dealers, North Carolina closed the background check loophole for handgun purchases through its now-repealed pistol purchase permit law.

### License and Carry Laws

North Carolina generally prohibits concealed carry without a permit, except for specific exemptions like military personnel and certain law enforcement officers. The state issues concealed handgun permits (CHP) through local sheriffâ€™s offices, requiring applicants to undergo criminal background checks and firearms safety training.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

To qualify for a CHP in North Carolina, applicants must:

  * Be a U.S. citizen or lawfully admitted permanent resident.
  * Be at least 21 years old.
  * Demonstrate competence with handguns through an approved training course.
  * Meet federal and state eligibility criteria, including mental health and criminal background checks.



### Open Carry and Location Restrictions

Open carry is permitted in North Carolina without a permit, subject to specific location restrictions. Prohibited areas include schools, law enforcement facilities, government buildings, and places where alcohol is served and consumed.
