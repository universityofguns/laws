### Purchasing Firearms

Georgia gun law does not require a permit to purchase, registration of firearms, or the licensing of owners. A permit to carry is only instituted for firearms that can be legally categorized as handguns. Under Georgia gun law, it is unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to possess a handgun. Consequently, it is illegal for any person to give, sell, or transfer a handgun to anyone under the age of 18. However, there are exceptions in which a minor may possess a handgun. A minor may possess a handgun with the permission of a parent, legal guardian, or under the supervision of a qualified or certified instructor, or professional.
