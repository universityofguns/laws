### Federal and State Context

Federal laws set foundational rules for firearm ownership, including restrictions on automatic weapons and prohibitions for certain individuals like felons and those with domestic violence convictions.

### Permitless Carry Legislation

Since 2019, South Dakota allows permitless carry, permitting individuals aged 18 and above, without disqualifying state or federal factors, to carry firearms openly or concealed. The state does not regulate assault weapons, large-capacity magazines, or ghost guns, emphasizing personal responsibility in compliance with laws.

### Concealed Carry Permits

South Dakota retains a concealed carry permit option for reciprocity with other states, offering regular, gold card, and enhanced permits. Applicants must meet strict criteria, including background checks and training for enhanced permits.

### Location Restrictions

State law prohibits carrying firearms in designated places such as courthouses, schools, and certain licensed establishments serving alcohol, with exceptions for authorized individuals like law enforcement and enhanced permit holders.

### Legal Framework

South Dakotaâ€™s legal framework categorizes offenses related to firearm possession and use, delineating penalties for violations ranging from misdemeanors to felonies based on the severity of the offense.
