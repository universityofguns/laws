### Federal and State Context

Federal laws set foundational rules for firearm ownership, including restrictions on automatic weapons and prohibitions for certain individuals like felons and those with domestic violence convictions.

### Permitless Carry Legislation

Since 2019, South Dakota allows permitless carry, permitting individuals aged 18 and above, without disqualifying state or federal factors, to carry firearms openly or concealed. The state does not regulate assault weapons, large-capacity magazines, or ghost guns, emphasizing personal responsibility in compliance with laws.
