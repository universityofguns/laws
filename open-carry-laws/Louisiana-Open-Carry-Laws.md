### Louisiana Open Carry Laws

Louisiana maintains some of the most permissive gun laws in the United States, reflecting a strong commitment to gun rights while balancing public safety considerations. Here‚Äôs an overview of Louisiana‚Äôs open carry laws and regulations:

### State Gun Control Overview

Louisiana does not require a license or permit to own firearms and imposes no state-level restrictions on assault weapons or large-capacity magazines. However, federal law mandates background checks for purchases through licensed dealers, excluding private sales.

### Constitutional Basis

The Louisiana Constitution affirms the right to keep and bear arms as fundamental, subject to strict scrutiny for any restrictions.

### Legal Restrictions and Court Upholdings

The Louisiana Supreme Court has upheld laws barring felons from firearm possession and validated the state‚Äôs concealed carry regulations, citing compelling state interests.

### Concealed Carry Permit Requirements

Louisiana is a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state for concealed carry permits. Applicants must be state residents aged 21 or older, free of disqualifying criminal or mental health histories, and complete a state-approved handgun safety course.

### Restricted Carry Locations

Carrying firearms, whether openly or concealed, is prohibited in specific locations, including law enforcement facilities, courthouses, schools, places of worship, and establishments with alcohol permits.

### Legislative Efforts

Recent legislative efforts in 2022 aimed to expand permitless carry were unsuccessful, though active-duty military and veterans in Louisiana gained exemptions.

### Preemption and Local Regulation

Louisiana‚Äôs preemption statute restricts localities like Baton Rouge from enforcing stricter gun laws than state standards.

### Relevant Statutes

Key Louisiana Revised Statutes cover illegal weapon possession, firearm prohibition for certain felonies, and restrictions around firearms on school grounds.
