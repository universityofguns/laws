### Federal and State Dynamics

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) oversees federal firearms regulations, which set standards for licensed dealers and restrict ownership of certain weapons. States like Oregon supplement federal laws with additional measures tailored to local needs.

### Oregonâ€™s Legislative Landscape

Oregonâ€™s constitution guarantees the right to bear arms while accommodating diverse urban and rural concerns. Major cities like Portland coexist with expansive public lands, influencing the stateâ€™s approach to firearm legislation.

### Open Carry and Assault Weapons

In Oregon, open carry of firearms is generally permitted, but restrictions apply in sensitive locations and urban areas concerned with public safety. The state does not currently prohibit assault weapons.

### Recent Legislation

In 2022, Oregon voters narrowly approved Measure 114, which introduced a ban on high-capacity magazines and mandated firearm purchase permits. This measure has faced legal challenges in state and federal courts.

### Concealed Handgun License (CHL)

To carry a concealed handgun in Oregon, residents must obtain a CHL, except when carrying a firearm at home or in their place of business. Applicants undergo a thorough process that includes a criminal background check and firearms competency demonstration.

### Restrictions and Location Prohibitions

CHL holders are subject to restrictions, including bans on carrying firearms in courthouses, secure correctional facility areas, and commercial airports. Oregon does not recognize reciprocity for out-of-state concealed carry licenses.

### Bans and Prohibitions

Oregon law prohibits undetectable firearms, defined as those not detectable by metal detectors or X-ray devices, and regulates the possession of unfinished firearm frames and receivers.
