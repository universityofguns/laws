### Nevada Open Carry Laws

Nevada, historically linked to the Old West, has been at the center of debates surrounding gun laws and public safety, particularly following the tragic 2017 Route 91 Harvest Music Festival shooting in Las Vegas. In response, Nevada has enacted various regulations aimed at balancing firearm rights with community safety.

### Federal Firearms Law

Under the Second Amendment, individuals have the right to bear arms, subject to state and federal regulations. The U.S. Supreme Court requires these regulations to be reasonable and historically supported. Federal law governs the manufacture, sale, possession, and use of firearms, overseen by the ATF.

### Nevadaâ€™s Firearms Regulations

Nevada defines firearms broadly and requires no permits for ownership or registration. The state banned bump stocks and requires criminal background checks for private firearm sales since 2020. Open carry is allowed statewide, but certain restrictions apply to loaded firearms in vehicles.

### Concealed Carry Permits

Nevada mandates a concealed carry permit for carrying a concealed firearm. Applicants must meet objective criteria, including age, residency, and passing a criminal background check. Specific locations, such as law enforcement facilities and schools, prohibit concealed carry.
