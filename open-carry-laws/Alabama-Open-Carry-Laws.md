### Historical Context

Alabama has historically upheld strong traditions of gun ownership, reflecting the rights granted under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. For many years, the state maintained lenient laws regarding firearm registration and licensing, with minimal enforcement of provisions.

### Recent Changes

In recent years, Alabama has implemented several changes aimed at tightening gun laws and enhancing public safety:

#### Permitless Carry Law

One of the most notable changes is the adoption of a permitless carry law, enacted in May 2021. This law allows individuals aged 21 and older to carry concealed handguns without a permit or mandatory training. It also permits the carrying of firearms in vehicles without a license, which supporters argue is beneficial for personal safety during travel.

Opponents have expressed concerns that the law may lead to increased gun-related incidents due to lack of training among permitless carriers.

#### Stricter Gun Dealer Regulations

Alabama has strengthened regulations for gun dealers, requiring them to maintain detailed records of firearm sales and undergo thorough background checks. These measures aim to curb illegal gun sales and enhance accountability within the firearms market.

#### Red Flag Law

Introduced in 2019, Alabamaâ€™s Red Flag Law enables family members or law enforcement officials to petition for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others. This law provides a legal framework to prevent firearm misuse during mental health crises.

#### Enhanced Concealed Carry Permits

The state has enhanced its concealed carry permit process, now requiring applicants to complete firearms training, undergo comprehensive background checks, and mental health evaluations. These stricter requirements aim to ensure that only qualified individuals receive concealed carry permits.
