### Kansas Open Carry Laws

State laws that control and regulate firearms can vary greatly. Legislators must respond to constituent concerns about gun violence and gun rights. The response in Kansas reflects a strong desire to infringe on the right to bear arms minimally. In contrast, neighboring Colorado imposes more restrictions on firearms to protect the public. Each state must strike a balance of competing interests.

The right to bear arms appears in the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s Second Amendment and several state constitutions. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that it is an individual right to arm oneself for self-defense and other lawful purposes. As a result, gun law and regulation challenges gain greater court scrutiny.

State residents are subject to federal and state laws that regulate firearms. The federal government regulates interstate commerce in firearms, requires registration of certain weapons like machine guns, and manages a licensing program for federal firearms dealers.

Federal law also bans possession of firearms by certain people, including felons, those using illegal drugs, those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, and others. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is a federal program that helps state and local law enforcement identify those who canâ€™t have a firearm under federal law.

### Kansas Gun Laws

Kansas did not enact a concealed handgun permit law until 2007 when it passed the Personal and Family Protection Act. Applicants for a concealed carry permit had to meet eligibility criteria and pass a criminal background check before the state issued a permit.

In 2015, the state adopted a permitless carry law. Under permitless carry, any gun owner who is 21 or older may carry a concealed firearm on or about their person without a permit. They must be law-abiding and cannot fall into a prohibited category. The office of the Kansas Attorney General still issues handgun permits so residents can qualify for reciprocity with other states.

As with other states, Kansas law allows banning firearms in certain locations. The public may not bring firearms into the capitol buildings in Topeka, the governorâ€™s home or grounds, any county courthouse (unless local authorities permit), or any state-owned or leased buildings with conspicuous signs saying guns are prohibited. But those who follow Kansas concealed carry law (permitted or permitless) may still have firearms in these areas. The lawful carrying of a concealed handgun can happen in most public access areas of state or municipal buildings.

The exception is where the government has placed adequate security measures, such as armed guards and metal detectors, at all public entrances. State law says that the government can ban anyone from carrying firearms in secure areas of a law enforcement agency, a correctional facility, a jail, or a courtroom (where they take adequate security measures). Firearms bans may also stand against anyone in certain other public buildings, including public-owned medical care facilities, indigent health care clinics, adult care homes, and community mental health centers.

Critics contend that Kansas gun control laws are too lax. Kansas doesnâ€™t have certain safeguards that other states have in place. For example, it doesnâ€™t require those engaging in private gun sales to get a criminal background check for the buyer. The state does not require gun owners to register their firearms or report lost or stolen guns. It also doesnâ€™t regulate assault weapons or transportation of firearms in motor vehicles.
