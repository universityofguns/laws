### Gun Control Laws in Wyoming

#### General Overview

Wyoming law does not require a license, permit, or registration to buy or own a firearm. The state sets the minimum age to buy a long gun (rifle or shotgun) at 18 and for a handgun (pistol or revolver) at 21.

#### Permitless Carry

Wyoming implemented a permitless carry law for residents in 2011, allowing qualified individuals to carry concealed firearms without a permit. This law expanded in 2021 to include qualified non-residents. Wyoming also offers a concealed firearms permit (CFP) for residents seeking reciprocity in other states. A state permit exempts holders from undergoing a background check when purchasing a new firearm from a federally licensed dealer.

#### Concealed Firearms Permit (CFP)

The Wyoming Attorney General’s office issues permits through local sheriff’s offices. Wyoming operates as a “shall issue” state, granting permits to applicants meeting objective eligibility criteria. Permits are valid for five years, subject to possible revocation if the holder becomes ineligible.

#### Prohibited Locations for Carrying Firearms

Certain locations prohibit firearms, including law enforcement facilities, detention centers, courtrooms, and school grounds.
